Interview 1:
Interviewer: Great.  I will explain to you how this interview works and what we are interested in.  As I said in the email, we’re interested in your experience with things and what you think the influence gaming has on society.  We have these PowerPoint slides I am sharing to guide our conversation on the topics we’re interested in.  I will share some keywords with you during our interview but you are not required to use them or to touch on every topic we are presenting.  You can just use them as cues to share your thoughts about gaming.  Okay?
Respondent 1: Okay.
Interviewer: So we will begin from your experience with gaming.  If you can tell me how you use games, how often, which kind of games?
Respondent 1: Sure.  I’ll just touch upon how often.  Probably most every day I would say, at least in some capacity.  I usually play with my friend in some capacity most every day whom he lives close to me so it’s not the only interaction we have but it helps keep in touch when we’re not seeing each other in person.  How much time?  Probably about maybe three to four hours a day average.  It’s not every day, sometimes I play a couple of hours, sometimes I play a little more if I have nothing else going on. 
Respondent 1: Which games?  Recently at least I play Overwatch, Dota 2.  We got Borderlands: The Pre-sequel and Humble Bundle, we’ve been playing that, it’s okay.  Personally I bought a Nintendo Switch somewhat recently so been playing some Zelda and Disgaea 5 which is a game I hadn’t heard of before.  So platforms is a PC and Switch.  I also have a 3DS I got also somewhat recently so I’ve been playing Fire Emblem.  
Interviewer: So you play both single player and multi player games?
Respondent 1: Yeah.  Typically when my friend is free I’ll play with him and when he’s at work or something or he’s busy I’ll play single player games.  Sometimes I’ll play by myself even when he’s available, if he wants to play a specific game that maybe he doesn’t want to play with me at the time.  Typically stuff like that.
Interviewer: If I may ask, you may not respond, how much do you spend on games typically?
Respondent 1: Like per month, per year?  Just a general—
Interviewer: Yeah, whatever comes easier to you.
Respondent 1: I don’t buy games a tonne, I typically try to be picky with games.  There’s games that I want but I can't play them now so there’s no purpose for me to buy them because I tend to stick with like three to four games and complete them fully at a time.  I probably buy maybe five games a year.  Sometimes maybe upwards of ten if a particularly numerous amount of games that resonate with me come out.  But I would say like around five games a year.  This past year, because I got two new consoles, I got the 3DS and the Switch, I’ve been buying slightly more games just to fill up the library.  It would still be around ten I would say in total.
Interviewer: Since when have you been a player?  From how long?
Respondent 1: Sure.  I mean, the first time I played video games when I was three or four I played the Mario Duck Hunt combo on the NES.  But I don’t know if I’d consider myself at that time, I was a little too young.  But I would say I’d started regularly playing games – I had a Game Boy as a young kid, but to get a little more serious I would say probably when I was between ten and twelve.  I got a Game Cube and then like Diablo 2 on the PC, I was big into that.  And then Guild Wars 1 was when I was like fourteen. I had an XBox 360 so I played a lot of that when that came out, what was that, 2006 I think.  And then after that some PC and then more recently I built a computer a couple of years ago so got more into that.
Interviewer: Thank you.  We’ll move to our next topic.  I forgot to ask, how old are you now?
Respondent 1: I’m twenty-five.
Interviewer: So it’s a little more than ten years you’ve been playing games?
Respondent 1: Yeah, for sure, I would say maybe around seventeen for real.
Interviewer: I will move to our next topic now that I understand how much you have been playing and which kind of games.  I’m interested in what you believe the influence of games are on people.  So if you see any influence that games has on you and if you believe they have an influence on other people.
Respondent 1: At least personally it’s a good – for lack of a better word – excuse to kind of keep in touch with people who you might not in another capacity.  I do have my friend, I see him every week anyway, but to talk to him every day bolsters our relationship.  Then I have a few friends who I met online who live in different states and you can bolster a relationship with them through games as a medium.  And it kind of builds – especially for like a cooperative multi player game or something, it helps build your relationship.  For a co-op experience you have to have teamwork and you kind of understand the nuances in their personality and how they might approach things.  So you kind of get to know them and their thought processes better in a way that you wouldn’t maybe normally experience through dialogue in person.  So to kind of foster relationships, I think it’s a good tool, at least for me.
Respondent 1: It’s also a good destressor, a time syncher or something like that, it’s not like you go home and be bored all day, you get home after work and you have dinner and then you might play games until you want to go to bed or something just because you have nothing else to do.  It makes time kind of fly by pretty fast.  I find it’s good to kind of get out of the world for a little bit and just focus on one thing.  So it’s kind of nice like that.  I don’t experience too much stress in my life, so I can't attest to how good of a destressor it is, but I reckon that for some people it probably works pretty good in that capacity.  Because you have to focus on the game and for some games you can get really invested in it and you forget what’s happening all round you, which can be good for your mental health and stuff like that.  What else influences me?  Those are the two major points.  I’m sure there’s finer details that I could really think about.
Interviewer: I put the key words we were thinking about when looking at this topic.  One you have already touched upon, collaboration and competition in gaming, you touched on collaboration and how for instance your social groups.
Respondent 1: Problem solving is interesting.  I think there’s some games where it can stimulate your mind in a way that you don’t experience on a regular basis with puzzles and such.  For example, in say Breath of the Wild there are some interesting puzzles in there that really I hadn’t experienced in a while.  They weren’t terribly difficult but they made me think in a way I wasn’t accustomed to and it was a good experience, so I wish games did that more.  
Respondent 1: So like for say Overwatch, I think your kind of tactical sense, in a way of trying to understand – at least the way I play the game, I try to think of how the opposing team understands where I am.  So I think from their perspective to try and navigate within the map that I don’t think that they will expect, does that make sense?
Interviewer: Yeah. 
Respondent 1: So I kind of have to think about how the enemy perceives the game and adjust my playing according to that.  I have to have an empathetic reading on how they might perceive the flow of the game.
Interviewer: So you are trying to get into their mind.
Respondent 1: Yeah.  Addiction, I’m sure some people are addicted for various reasons.  I don’t know quite what the border of addiction and frequent hobby is.  I think it would be if you have trouble not playing a game for a few days, that might be addiction.  But at least personally I don’t mind not playing for a few days.  Physical activity.  It’s a mostly sedentary activity.  I’m sure for some motion games there’s various amount of physical activity but I don’t think it’s anything strenuous or anything like that.  So it’s probably not great if you want to get in shape.  But as long as you have a good diet and some physical exercise I don’t think it’s too bad.  
Respondent 1: It compounds where it takes a lot of time and some games you are tempted to complete it so you might have less time to be mindful of your body or something like that.  But that’s only conjecture, I can't attest to that personally.  I don’t know if there any other point you want me to give my opinion on?
Interviewer: That’s okay.  What I would like to know from you, you said you are training in a way practical thinking and solving puzzles in games.  
Respondent 1: Yeah.
Interviewer: And you have been playing for a long time, I was wondering if you feel you got better over time at these kind of tasks?
Respondent 1: Yeah.  So especially for games, like a puzzle game, at first you might – or for any game, you don’t know the rules of the game, the rules of the world.  You know the loose rules but maybe how the AI interacts with things or how it expects you to use mechanics.  When you first start the game you don’t know but over time you learn the quirks of the game.  Like maybe you kind of know how the AI might react to certain situations because you learn it over time.  Or how combining mechanics, you know how to expect them to interact with one another.  So I think every game has its – and you might not even do it consciously, but every game has a learning curve of the intricacies of the mechanics of the game and the more familiar you are with those little nuances the more easily you can adapt to situations or solve puzzles or use the mechanics to your benefit in a way that you can better predict over time.
Interviewer: Thank you.  Moving on to our third topic, which is do you know or can you think of practical applications of games?  So games used not only for the entertainment value but for some other kind of purposes?
Respondent 1: Sure.  I mean, the first thing that comes to mind, for a little while the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games, it doesn’t teach you guitar but it kind of helps people that might not have an instrument improve their hand/eye coordination in regards to timing and rhythm and get used to moving their hand muscles in new ways.  I personally do play guitar but it kind of helps strengthen muscles in your fingers that you wouldn’t use otherwise, or for Rock Band playing drums, that virtually is kind of close to playing drums rhythm wise, so it’s a good way to experience those things without maybe the money investment of buying a full instrument.  But those games are kind of out of favour.  I’m trying to think of other more recent examples.
Respondent 1: Handheld puzzle games and stuff like that are probably good for children just to – their minds are growing, so experiencing puzzles and having them have to think in ways they haven't had to are probably good for children.  Because they have school but game puzzles are slightly different, you don’t really do puzzles in school, it’s more academic curriculum.  So it’s probably good for children, general puzzle games.  Beyond that maybe there’s games like dance games that might help improve how you perceive the space of your body and you can maybe have better movement or something like that.  But I’m not sure, that’s the only other thing that comes to my mind.
Interviewer: You said about puzzle games for helping children learn, and you said they can be complementary in a way to school, because in school they have more academic approach.  But do you actually think that games could be used in school?
Respondent 1: I think they could, because also kids – or many kids like games but don’t like school, does that make sense?
Interviewer: Yeah.
Respondent 1: So it kind of makes them interested and invested in the activity if it’s a game.  If it’s properly created then kids would look forward to doing stuff like that and also learn.  I don’t know if it’d be as good as straight curriculum learning, but as maybe a complementary thing it probably has some pretty good merit in that regard.
Interviewer: Something that interests me in what you said, you said that if they’re properly created, what do you mean by that?  How could a game be properly created for school?  What does it have to have or do?
Respondent 1: Probably the most important thing is whether or not the activities in the game or what you get out of the game is directly relevant to something.  You can make a fun game but if they don’t really get anything out of it relevant to – I mean, in a school setting, then it’s just a game, it’s not really a learning game.  Maybe they’ll learn different things but in a school setting it probably should be focussed on the curriculum. So as long as it shows some kind of tangible improvement in some sense, maybe their memory of vocabulary or something or the speed at which they solve maths problems or remember words, I don't know exactly the metrics of how you would measure it, it would depend on the game.  
Respondent 1: As long as there’s some kind of tangible improvement that would probably be the first priority.  And beyond that the game has to work, the mechanics need to work together, it probably should be fun, (laughs) if it’s not fun then it’ll become a chore.  As long as it finds a way to make a fun game that also in some way aids the children with whatever subject matter is at hand then I’d say it would be successful. 
Interviewer: Another thing I wanted to ask is are you familiar with the terms serious games and gamification?
Respondent 1: I know about gamification.  Serious games, I mean, I know games which are serious in tone but I don’t know if there’s a definition beyond that, could you—?
Interviewer: What we mean actually by serious games are games that are not created for entertainment.  That are for example created for school.
Respondent 1: I know about gamification where you’d take a concept and apply a game over it or give it gaming properties, that’s what I assume gamification is.
Interviewer: We formally define it as the use of game elements in a context that is not a game, so for that purpose.
Respondent 1: Yeah, that makes sense. 
Interviewer: Do you have any experience with gamification?
Respondent 1: I feel like I have but I can't think of the exact – I remember when I was in maybe fourth to sixth grade we had some kind of computer class.  And I remember doing some kind of game on the computer, but I can't recall – it was maybe a Sudoku kind of thing, something like that, where it was like a mathy logic thing, but I can't recall the exact example.  I apologise for that.  I’m trying to think of something I can remember.  I mean, I’ve done some psychology experiments through school that were kind of gamified where – for like say reaction time or something like that.  It kind of had a gamey sense but not quite.  I did do a study for gaming feedback, but that kind of is a game anyway.  Yeah, I don’t have that much personal, unless you maybe have examples that could job my memory, but that’s kind of risky.
Interviewer: An example of gamification that a lot of people use are those kind of apps that track for example how much you run or how much you exercise and they give points and make it something of a competition between your friends.
Respondent 1: I get that.  I don’t personally use anything like that.  I know people that do.  And I guess, yeah, it’s kind of like you have your number, say you want to do ten thousand steps or something and you see you have eight thousand and it’s the middle of the day, you kind of feel like you want to hit that goal.  So you might end up doing a walk where you otherwise wouldn’t because you don’t have that tangible goal in front of you.  
Interviewer: I will move to the next topic which is about ethical issues.  What kind of ethical issues you see with gaming and games and maybe then the message that games can give.  
Respondent 1: So just general ethics?
Interviewer: Whatever comes to your mind.
Respondent 1: I think it would be hard for a game to become unethical.  They can tell any story they want, as long as – I mean, they’re not affecting anything directly.  Maybe an example, people might be opposed to games like Grand Theft Auto or something like this because of the themes and you’re capable of harming MPCs or what have you.  But some people say video games cause violence or whatever, but I think there’s a distinct area where your mind makes, you understand it’s a game and it doesn’t have real consequences beyond wasting your time.  Obviously there are cases where maybe people don’t have that barrier but I would say those are outlying cases, but for a general person, killing somebody in a game doesn’t make them want to kill someone in real life.  It might be an outlet for feelings or whatever, but I don’t think that it’ll make them do anything in real life any more than before.  
Respondent 1: For the average person it would do it less, for outliers it might make them want to do it more but then that’s probably a symptom of some kind of mental condition, it wouldn’t be a regular person.  But for ethics like – what was that game that came out in 2014, it was some game where you basically go on a killing rampage or something.  It was a big news deal at the time because it was banned on Steam or something.
Interviewer: I remember the title, it was something like Hatred for the title, I don’t remember the exact title, but it was something like that.
Respondent 1: Yeah.  So something like that, that’s controversial.  And the tone of the game is quite dark.  In Grand Theft Auto the objective is not to kill random people but for that game it is.  And I see the trailer for that and I think, oh, that’s kind of odd, but it’s maybe not for me.  But for some people it might be for them.  If it’s a good game it’s a good game.  I think the controversy of that was how gory and detailed it is and the objective of the game is basically to solely kill innocent people.  But again, it is a game and there’s kind of the mental barrier where it kind of, you know—
Interviewer: So you wouldn’t say it’s a big ethical issue, the presence of violence in games, because there is a strong barrier?
Respondent 1: I don’t think it’s unethical.  I think there’s probably some line but I don’t think it’s been crossed.  Or at least not in my experience.  To kill someone in real life is unethical, to kill someone in a game I don’t think that’s unethical.  Or to depict violence against say children, I don’t think it’s unethical in a game because it isn't real, it’s just data and it’s pixels, it’s not living people or real peoples’ emotions and feelings and stuff like that.
Interviewer: It is the assumption that most games shy away from depicting or permitting hurting a fictional child.
Respondent 1: Yeah, that’s kind of a taboo thing, where most games don’t let you do anything with children.  But again, I think if they let you do something to adults and not children, it kind of makes you feel it’s more of a game, does that make sense?  It kind of takes you out of the realism of the game.  There’s ways around it.  I think the reason they don’t do it is mainly due to possible public outlash.  I don’t think it’s due to their own personal beliefs.  I can't say.  But I think the fear of public outlash is maybe the motivator.  Say for Bethesda game, there’s children in the game and you can't kill them, you can kill adults.  But then there’s mods where you can kill children.  So are those mods unethical?  I don’t think so.
Interviewer: You think it’s more of a marketing thing?
Respondent 1: Yeah.  I haven't played it, but the game Spec Ops: The Line, it’s a shooting game that tackles serious issues of like nuclear fallout and genocide and children are involved in that.  You’re not personally killing children but it’s more you might feel more emotionally invested in it because of its realistic depiction of a hypothetical scenario of violence.  So it might elicit more emotional response but I think that’s perfectly ethical.  And I think you have more leeway with games.  Like if you don’t sensor yourself in the story you want to tell you have more leeway to kind of elicit maybe ethical questions that the viewer might ask.  Yeah, so that’s a good example.  
Respondent 1: I think games are a good medium to present ethical questions to gamers in the same way maybe like a hypothetical ethics college course might, where you present an example and say, if someone did this would it be ethical?  I think it presents a good way for you to kind of firsthand experience it in not just in your mind kind of thing, because you kind of have to do actions one way or the other.  So it can kind of present ethical conundrums in a way that’s more tangible to a person and makes them think about it more.  If that’s what the game wants to be, some games are just games for games.  But I think it’s a good medium to present ethical questions to players in a way that might impact them more.
Interviewer: Yeah, in a way that there are consequences but not in the real world, I see what you mean.
Respondent 1: Kind of like a sudo consequence but it’s not real life consequences.
Interviewer: I’d still like you to say a little bit more on this topic of ethical issues and ask for example what do you think about the portrayals of gender and race in games?
Respondent 1: I think the climate right now is a little up in the air I guess.  
Interviewer: What do you mean by that?
Respondent 1: Right now people – so I don't know, this might be a little – I’m just thinking the most recent thing I’ve seen is – so Far Cry 5 I believe the initial reveal without information shows what people perceive to be white rednecks or something of that sort.  And people were thrilled – I will be careful with what I say because I don’t know personally these people – some people were enthused that finally they were able to kill white rednecks or something like that.  I think that’s a little – and then when it revealed that it’s not all white rednecks, they were angry about it, that it wasn’t a white killing simulator.  So most games, say Call of Duty, you’re in a different country and your enemies are primarily members of that country who might be of a different race.  
Respondent 1: So people might perceive that as being racist, but I think there’s a level of accuracy that you should probably expect.  Or for say old war games, so for World War 1 or Battlefield 1 there weren’t – historically there weren’t black fighters for the US, for other countries I believe there were some.  But not for the US.  So when you depict soldiers in the US army people might be mad that there aren’t black soldiers.  Again, sure they could add them, if they want to be historically I don’t think it should be expected for them to twist history.  Again, it’s the developer’s choice whether or not they can do that.  Violence against women or – what’s the word for it, [extra fan 0:37:38] service or something.  Honestly, it’s the developer’s prerogative whether they feel it’s okay.  Because I think the developer should be able to make the game they want to make.  
Respondent 1: If you don’t agree with that game then you don’t need to buy that game.  I don’t think that developers should – so a developer fears that if they don’t do something with race or gender that their sales might be severely impacted, then by all means they should maybe consider making the game in a way that’s more marketable to those people.  But again, I think if you make the game that you desire to make and it’s a good game, people will buy it.  And if people don’t agree with how something is treated then they’re welcome not to buy the game.  I don’t think that they should be forced to appeal to a demographic that they don’t feel like aligns with their vision of the game.
Interviewer: Another thing I wanted to ask, you have been a gamer for a long time.  Once, I mean, the marketing of games was really easy, you bought the game and from then on you had the game and you could play it at any time.  More recently there have been other ways of buying games, from subscriptions to free to play games in which you can buy some kind of advantage inside the game, but the game itself is free.  And there are more and more DLCs.  Do you think something about that, have you experienced games with these kind of selling strategies?
Respondent 1: Yeah.  So Dota 2 is free to play.  I reckon it’s probably the best iteration of a free to play game, in that all of the game content is unlocked.  You don’t need to unlock the heroes individually, they’re all available.  The only thing that you do buy are cosmetics or voice announcers, stuff that does not impact the game or the metagame in any way, shape or form.  For like say League of Legends or what have you, you can use real life currency but you can unlock whatever in game currency.  The statistics on how long it takes to actually unlock everything in the game is two to three years.  I think that’s okay.  I mean, it is a free game and you can play it.  You’re slowly unlocking more which kind of gives it a sense of progression and carrot and stick kind of sensation that gamers like.  In Dota 2 your motivation for playing the game is playing the game, it’s not unlocking more things.  I think they kind of appeal to different people.  
Respondent 1: Say for mobile games, for that one it’s usually the game is free but it’s paid to speed up things.  It makes it like the free version may be quite slow and say, this task will take an hour or twelve hours or you can pay a dollar to do it right now, so you don’t have to wait.  Or the difficulty might amp up in such a way where it might be hard if not impossible to progress after a certain point without paying to get upgrades or something like that.  And then there’s the games where they [rely on the whales 0:42:06], where you can spend a thousand dollars to get something.  I think that’s kind of— I think that crosses the ethical line where they’re praying on people who might be predisposed to addiction.  It’s almost gambling.  So I think that’s probably not good.  For the League of Legends model, I think it’s okay, it’s not great.  I prefer the Dota model because I think it’s the best because it’s the most fair to gamers.
Interviewer: Yeah, it doesn’t change your chance of winning.
Respondent 1: Because they get the game in its entirety and everything else is cosmetic.  I think Smite has where if you pay thirty dollars for the game, the game is free and you can unlock heroes with the game currency or you can pay thirty dollars and get all the heroes forever, you never have to buy another hero.  So you have that option.  I think that’s a fair trade.  Thirty dollars is less expensive than what it would be to buy everything in League of Legends with real money, it would be like ten thousand dollars or something crazy.  I’m not that familiar with League of Legends, I played it a long time ago but I don’t know what it is about now.  Those examples were the ones who came into my mind.  Was there something I missed?  Sorry, I’m a little rambling.
Interviewer: Don’t worry (laughs).  We’ll move to the next topic, we’re nearing the end of the interview.  I wanted to ask how do you see that games influence society?
Respondent 1: Sorry, you just cut out for a few seconds there.
Interviewer: Sorry. I wanted to ask you how do you see that games influences society or how do you think that they influence society?  So in your experience or more in general.  It’s a very abstract question.
Respondent 1: Yeah (laughs).  So I think at least for the younger generations, I mean, I know some people in older generations have got into gaming in some way or another, but I think it’s becoming more and more culturally accepted to play games in America.  I know in other regions of the world, like say for South Korea, it’s very accepted and they have PC cafés everywhere and gaming is—
Interviewer: What do you mean by culturally accepted?
Respondent 1: I mean, there’s this stigma of playing games is wasting your time or you don’t get anything out of it.  Go outside or why don’t you do stuff with your friends in person.  Stuff like that is somewhat common criticism, it’s kind of died down now.  Games is another media, it’s television, it’s movies, but I think it can kind of for some people maybe be more gratifying because the experience is typically longer, you have direct control over actions, say for a story driven RPG you can kind of answer how you see fit and potentially drive the story in a different way.  You can't do that with a movie, the movie is already what it is.  I think as a media it’s becoming more acceptable to tell stories through games and have them be accepted as almost like a movie or a book or something.  
Respondent 1: It kind of has the same – it’s a story they want to tell and the medium they use is games instead of a movie or a book or a television show.  It’s another way to tell a story.  Some games are just games for the sake of being games.  But I think as the idea that games can be thought provoking or something like that, the society has become more in tune with that idea, that games might have merit – they have merit and you do talk with friends and you can make friends or become better friends with people who you might not otherwise as that’s becoming more—
Interviewer: You said you have been seeing a change in how games are considered in the US you are saying they are becoming more accepted over time?
Respondent 1: Yeah, you know, eSports, the tournaments are getting bigger and bigger around the US and around the world.  In general more people, with the advent of streaming services like Twitch and whatever, watching games.  That’s become a new thing instead of like where they might play games or watch TV they might just watch games.  The more that people are exposed to that, so say for a parent who might not play games, seeing that behaviour might seem odd but the more they’re exposed to it the more they can kind of reconcile the idea that the culture is becoming more – I don’t want to say game centric, but games have become more and more popular, viewing and playing games, streaming games.  
Respondent 1: So the more they’re exposed to that the more they have to accept that that’s the way things have been going recently in the climate.  So I think it’s becoming more acceptable to be a gamer and have a gamer identity.  And there’s cons and what not.  It’s big marketing and investments and stuff, people are becoming more and more invested into gaming companies and stuff like that and they’re becoming overall more accepted over time.  It’s a slow process but I think it’s speeding up somewhat.
Interviewer: There is something I want to ask you.  Because you talked about the gamer identity and also before when you were recounting your experience with games you began by saying that I was already playing games when I was eleven, twelve, but I wasn’t yet a gamer, I wouldn't consider a gamer.  What do you mean by a gamer identity?  I’m trying to understand.
Respondent 1: I got you.  So when I was younger and I played NES and Game Boy I played them because they were there but after I was done with the game I was kind of done with the game and I kind of just went into limbo until another game came out because I was young and I didn’t have agency.  What does it mean to be a gamer?  I think if you regularly play games and seek out new games and experiences consistently, like there’s little to no downtime.  Of course you could be a gamer with having downtime but I think the desire to consume games as a media and games resonate with you I think would be enough to consider yourself “gamer”.  
Respondent 1: Is someone that plays mobile games sometimes on their phone a gamer?  I’d say loosely, I wouldn’t consider them a gamer though.  I think there needs to be some kind of commitment to – I don't know, I can't bash mobile games that way because I can't speak for people.  If someone plays like Bejewelled all the time I probably wouldn’t consider them a gamer, but maybe that’s a little elitist, I don't know.  I think the gamer carries a certain stigma where you have to kind of – maybe like a breadth of games, maybe not across genres but maybe more seriously time committed games and have a serious commitment.  Like if you’re seriously committed to Tetrus only I’d say you’re a gamer, because there’s some kind of competition in it, but I don't know.  
Respondent 1: So I guess the same could be applied to Candy Crush, but can it?  I don't know, those are questions I hadn’t really thought about.  There’s some kind of line, I don’t know where it stands.  But I think if you like gaming culture and you maybe watch games or you play games regularly yourself, by yourself or with friends, and you talk about games, especially the latter, I think that would be more than enough to qualify yourself as a gamer, yeah.
Interviewer: I see what you mean.  Which is a little different from what you said in the first place.  You said about time commitment to games, but now you’re defining it more as thinking about games and talking about games and watching games, so—
Respondent 1: I think they probably go—
Interviewer: Taking the games outside from the time in which you are gaming.
Respondent 1: I think they kind of go hand in hand.  I think the more you play a game the more you’re inclined to talk about it and be able to talk about it.  I think it would be more difficult if you did not play games to be able to have – to even express a desire to talk about the games because you don’t really play them.  You know what I mean?  So I think they kind of go hand in hand.  But I think one is a symptom of the other and vice versa.  I think if you talk about games a lot you’re more inclined to play them and if you play a lot of games you’re more inclined to talk about them.  Yeah, I think that just that mentality is maybe what pushes over to say you’re a gamer.  I think you can play games and not be like – have that gamer identity, if you just play—  
Respondent 1: But that’s just the nomenclature of the word gamer, of what it’s been defined as.  I mean, yeah, so I think if you’re invested enough into playing games where they come up in dialogue or you think about them in your spare time – yeah, if you play enough games where that becomes a common occurrence I think that’s when you can probably say you have the gamer identity because it becomes part of your identity, it’s part of how you think of things and how you talk about things.  So I think when it becomes part of your identity in that sense you have the gamer identity.  
Interviewer: I think I got it.
Respondent 1: Yeah, if you need me maybe to rephrase things I can.
Interviewer: Another thing you touched upon that I wanted to focus a little more on, you said that games are becoming more accepted as a medium to tell stories, like movies and like books, right?
Respondent 1: Right.
Interviewer: Would you even consider them as a way of expressing art, of making art?
Respondent 1: Yeah, there are sure some artistic games.  Some art styles on the part of game development and just overall, and stylisation, so some games are just visually breathtaking even, or interesting.  There are some games where it’s more about the visuals than it is about the game.  Like a walking simulator or something like that, where they’re just trying to convey an experience and it has a loose game feeling.  Because there’s no – you just walk around, you might interact with a few things but beyond that there’s no peril, there’s no combat, puzzles or story, it’s just walking around.  But it’s still art, it has artistic merit because of how the art is presented to itself.  
Respondent 1: I mean, you can put – if an artist paints a painting to put in a game – not paint a painting but creates an image of a painting in a game, they still made that painting and it’s still in the game.  So that can apply to the whole landscape or vistas that might be in open world games can be visually stunning.  Or a game like Ori and the Blind Forest or whatever, that has a visually stylised take on things.  
Respondent 1: For someone to say that isn't art in its own way because you can interact with it, I think that’s not true.  Just because you can interact with it and maybe change the shape of things, I think it is a good medium to express art.  And it’s even becoming – like some VR, I know there’s some art that’s just VR art, that’s it.  You just look at it, it’s just like three dimensional or something like that.  I definitely think that obviously not all games are art but I think a lot of art is in games, a lot of games are, yeah.
Interviewer: Another thing I wanted to ask before moving to the last topic is about the regulation of games.  You were talking before about how you see that violent games are not a problem, because you see a clear divide between the game and the real world.  But of course that’s a hotly debated topic, you know.
Respondent 1: Yeah.
Interviewer: For example, that there is a lot of regulation, especially in the US, about who you can sell games to, so at which age you can begin playing a particular game.  Parents also can limit what games their children are playing.  What do you think about that?
Respondent 1: I think it exists for a reason.  Whether or not the numbers of when you can buy – the age when you can buy certain games might be up for debate.  So a game like Grand Theft Auto, you probably shouldn’t have a five year old playing that game because they haven't developed maybe the mental capacity to separate it.  So what is it, it’s seventeen or eighteen, in Europe it’s PEGI, so PEGI sixteen right?
Interviewer: I think so, I’m not that sure actually. (Laughs)  I think it’s sixteen or eighteen.
Respondent 1: Yeah.  Parents can bypass it, the parents can buy the game and give it to the children if they choose.  I think there should be some kind of rating regulation which there is, the kids can play the game if the parent buys it for them.  I guess they could also just buy it online, no one’s going to ask them for their age, but I guess they have to have a way to pay for it in that case so probably the parent’s credit card.  They’re not prohibited from playing the game, they’re prohibited from buying the game.  
Respondent 1: So I guess for Grand Theft Auto, I would presume a sixteen year old could play that game and be fine.  Maybe lower than that I would say, but you can't buy it yourself until you’re eighteen say in the US.  I think that’s kind of weird.  It’s the same with movies, where it’s like PG, thirteen and rated R, where if it’s rated R if you’re under seventeen you can't see it.  I don't know, I think it’s a little too high but not by much, I think it’s close.  I think PEGIs are about two years shorter, I think that’s a little more accurate.  
Respondent 1: Then there’s some cases where you need to be even older, but there’s only a few games in that category where it’s like – I don't know what the PEGI is, but there’s like a beyond R rating, but I think that’s only reserved for very, very few games.  I think it exists for a reason.  I think there are developmental milestones you probably should reach before being exposed to particular types of games.  But the time at which a person experiences those milestones varies.  So I think parents using their best judgement is probably the best system and the hard ratings kind of just put hard numbers and facilitates that to some extent.  But I could probably be shortened a few years.  It’s up in the air, there are probably some studies that have to be done before, I don't know, I can't tell you.  Does that answer your question, sorry?
Interviewer: Yes, thank you.  I will move to the last theme of the interview which is what suggestions would you make to different figures that are involved with games to better use them or better create them?  I don't know if the question is clear?
Respondent 1: Like what – so what advice would I maybe give to game developers to make a better game more or less?
Interviewer: Yeah.
Respondent 1: Sure.  I think if you have a vision, I think number one you need to be passionate about the game you want to make and the vision you have for it.  And I think you should strive to create that vision, maybe don’t compromise a tonne, unless obviously someone says, this is bad.  But I think you also need to be open to ideas.  Say you want to make a story game.  Tell the story that you want to tell, don’t try and tell the story that you want people to like.
Interviewer: You think [1:04:29]?
Respondent 1: Yeah.  I think that some – it’s a little difficult.  I think some games, not all games, try to kind of dip their fingers in too many pies, they’ll try and do too much and it kind of takes away from the whole experience where doing a few things good leads to a better experience than doing a lot of things kind of mediocre.  I think you need to be realistic in the vision and I think—  So for developers that are contractually obligated or they’re being funded by EA or something, they’re more pressured to adhere to a timeline and not delay a game.  But I think, what’s the saying, like a delayed game is eventually good but a bad game now is forever bad.  I think that’s pretty apt.  
Respondent 1: I think that if you feel that a game is poor or it’s not quite where it needs to be in your vision, if you can, I would delay the game and work on it.  But then again, if you’re under a producer and they say, we don’t want to pay you – because delaying a game costs a lot of money.  So obviously there’s a lot of pressure not to do that and to just push it out.  But I think that if the game isn't where you want it to be and there’s no way for you to fix it afterward, then don’t – try your best to delay the game and try to get it to the play where you want it to be.  Because games move fast and if your game comes out and it’s bad it might as well not have ever come out.  Because even if it becomes good, people aren’t going to pay credence to it.  Because new games are coming out and they’ve got other things to play.  You basically have one shot.  
Respondent 1: The release reception is – in most cases, there’s some exceptions – the release reception is the only public perception that your game is going to get.  So if your game comes out and it gets good reviews, like it’s going to have good reviews for ever.  That’s where it is on Metacritic or whatever, because those are permanent, they don’t get updated depending on how the game does.  I think that being…
Interviewer: It should be good from the start.
Respondent 1: …sale oriented and making sure that the game is how you want it to be when you release it I think is important.  Obviously there are some cases where it’s just irredeemable and you don’t have enough time in the world to fix it.  But I think if you can manage your time properly to make—  Also, I’m pretty sure a lot of bad games are a result of poor management and poor communication.  So that’s kind of a small point, but I think that’s probably one of the most important things.  Because all of the back interviews that I’ve heard about poor games have been a result of poor management and communication.  
Respondent 1: So I think game managers probably should make sure that they want to be doing what they’re doing and to have an understanding of how the whole process should be done.  Make sure the game’s fun, the game needs to be fun first and foremost.  A game has to be fun.  Or maybe not fun but compelling or – if you want to make a game for fun sake it needs to be fun.  If you want to make a game that’s compelling you need to make it compelling, like first and foremost.  If you want to make a game that’s art you need to make sure it’s artistic first and foremost.  Make sure your game ends up being what your vision wants it to be, don’t get sidetracked and try and add a bunch of things that take away from your vision.
Interviewer: Don’t try to compromise too much, right.
Respondent 1: Yeah.  So there’s a fine line between taking criticism and being collaborative and compromise and not compromising.  I think that if you’re confident in your vision enough and you try and strive to make your vision.  If your vision’s bad and you’re confident in your bad vision then that’s probably not going to be a good result because you’re not going to compromise, and sometimes compromising can make a bad vision into a good vision.  I think you need to be self aware and just be mindful of the level of compromise that you need to achieve and the level of – you have to be stalwart in making sure that if you believe your vision is good and people want to experience it, then make sure that’s what gets into the gamers’ hands.
Interviewer: Is there anything else you want to add, even on something we have not touched on?
Respondent 1: Nothing immediately comes to mind.  I don't know if you have any miscellaneous things?
Interviewer: I don’t think so.  So I will end the interview.

Interview 2:
Interviewer: I will explain to you how this interview works.  As I said, we are interested in your experience with gaming, video games or games which are at least in part digital.  More in general about what are your thoughts on the influence of games in society.  During the interview you shall see – I am sharing the screen.
Respondent 2: I can see it.
Interviewer: We have these PowerPoint slides that will guide our conversation.  And we have six big themes we will cover.  For each of them we have a few keywords that can just help you find something to talk about.  So I will show those keywords like this but you are not required to use all of them and talk about all of them, you can just take them as cues for finding what you think, what you want to talk about.  Okay?
Respondent 2: Fine.
Interviewer: I will begin.  As I said, we are interested also in your experience with games and we will start with that.  If you can tell me what type of games you play, how long you have been playing and so on?
Respondent 2: Sure.  Lately it’s been kind of competitive games where I play RTS, strategy games, platformers, just about every game imaginable.  And I’ve been playing as long as I can remember, as least since middle school.  I don’t have too much memories of elementary school but as long as I can remember playing video games so I’m pretty into the scene.
Interviewer: Do you play single player, multi player?
Respondent 2: Both.  Multi player is definitely becoming more and more popular for me, because there’s a – especially I just moved out of state so I don’t really know people in this area and multi player games have been a great way for me to stay in contact with my friends.  My friends that live far away, if we play a similar video game we stay in contact far more often than friends I have that don’t play the same game as I do.  So it’s a great way for me to keep my friendships up.
Interviewer: Where are you from originally?
Respondent 2: Michigan.  I just moved down to Kentucky.
Interviewer: How old are you?
Respondent 2: I’m twenty-six. 
Interviewer: What kinds of platform do you use?  Computer or—
Respondent 2: PC almost exclusively.  I do have a Nintendo Switch but it’s almost all PC, it’s the best way to play. 
Interviewer: And you don’t play on mobile?
Respondent 2: I don’t play any phone games at all.  Oh, chess, I play chess with a friend but that doesn’t really count (laughs).
Interviewer: Another thing I wanted to ask, but of course you are free not to answer me, is how much money you spend on games typically?
Respondent 2: I can give you a pretty good answer to that.  Let me look it up one second.  I play all my games through Steam and there’s a website that calculates how much money you’ve spent.  They have sales, so sometimes a game will go down to twenty bucks when it’s usually fifty, so it gives you a range of how much you could have spent.  So somewhere between thirteen hundred dollars and three thousand eight hundred dollars.  It’s probably somewhere in the middle there, I buy quite a bit on sale but definitely I wouldn’t maximise.  Let me say that this has some really good statistics.  There we go.  Every game I’ve bought in the last six years probably, it also shows like average price per hour that I’ve played.  Lots of interesting information there.
Interviewer: Thank you.  I will move to a harder question, which is what influence do you think games have on people?  What influence do you feel gaming has on you?  And what influence do you think games have on other people?
Respondent 2: That’s a very complicated question.  It depends a lot and I think my relationship with games has kind of changed over the years quite a bit.  I will say I think – I’ll start with the positives, the value that I think gaming gives to people.  On the positive ends, I think games in a lot of ways it’s like problem solving just distilled in its more purest form.  And it’s really beneficial that people are addicted to problem solving, and games are constantly putting up issues or blockers in your way that you don’t understand, you can't get past a certain area, and you have to get creative and figure out how you get past certain scenarios.  Which is great, I think it’s a good sign. 
Respondent 2: Also, I talked about this earlier, the social aspect, me being able to keep in contact with some friends and family through playing it.  And it definitely is a – I think they call it a – what’s the word – a cooperative cognitive artefact, it’s something that when you do it it helps you with other problem solving outside of the games and gives you a good toolset.  I think this is going to get more extreme as we go on, we’re going to be presented with – you get presented with scenarios in video games that are impossible in the real world, like they can't exist.  
Respondent 2: I think Antichamber is a game that’s a really good example of this, where you’re navigating in a four dimensional geometric maze, and you can't do that in real life.  The best puzzle that I’ve experienced, it’s the first one in it, is you have two sets of stairs, one that goes up, one that goes down.  You go up the stairs that go up and they go round a corner and you end up exactly where you started.  You go down the stairs, you go round a corner and you’re exactly where you started.  How do you get past this puzzle?  If you turn around and go the opposite direction, all of a sudden you go through a different path and you end up somewhere completely different.  
Respondent 2: This is a geometry that’s completely impossible in real life, but it kind of gives you intuitive sense of how your dimensional geometry works.  And I think especially for kids playing this, I think that would be hugely beneficial for them to understand math and other concepts.  You take that same scenario and put it in a virtual reality and now they’re literally navigating impossible geometries.  I’m curious to see how that would really affect peoples’ understandings of these not really intuitive concepts.
Respondent 2: The more negative side is that video games are super addictive by design, I’ve definitely had an issue, struggled with game addiction.  I’ve gotten much better at it, I’m about an hour a day now which is I think pretty good wind down time.  But it’s really easy to get hooked on these things and just spend all your time on it.  I think it provides a lot of benefits but anything in excess is a problem of course.  
Interviewer: May I ask you how long did you play for?
Respondent 2: It depends, I think at my worst I was probably doing like four hours a day, four or five.  And that was pretty bad (laughs).
Interviewer: So you decided yourself to tone down how much you play?
Respondent 2: Yes.  
Interviewer: You actually already touched two of the keywords we put about addiction and about cognitive benefits like problem solving.  I would like to ask you about the effect of physical activity of games?  You said you play mostly – or only sedentary games, right?
Respondent 2: Mostly PC games, and I’m sedentary, I’m sitting down playing.  I got virtual reality recently, so that’s kind of changing.  Those games are very active.  Some of them I can only play thirty, forty-five minutes before I’m just exhausted, I have to take a break.  I think that’s changing but games have definitely made me – games and work – I mean, my whole life is pretty sedentary, and I have to go well out of my way to make time to be active and move, which is tricky.  But everything in society wants me to sit down and not do that.
Interviewer: Something you already touched a bit on is about collaborating when playing games or competing when playing games.  Do you have any thoughts on that?
Respondent 2: Yeah, it’s one of my favourite aspects of video games by far is the collaboration.  And being in constant contact.  The game I play mostly right now is Rocket League which is a team based game and it’s heavily communicative, where I’m just constantly, “I’m going over here, what do you do?  This is what I’m doing.”  We’re in constant communication with each other.  And I play exclusively with friends that I had in real life in Michigan so I keep in contact with them.  Puzzle games, like Portal, their multi player are just some of the best games, when you have a puzzle and you work with someone else to try to solve the issue with them, it’s a great experience.
Interviewer: If you don’t have anything else to add I will move to the next topic.
Respondent 2: I’m just looking at these words really quickly.  Yeah, I’m good.
Interviewer: Another thing we’re interested in and also you already touched on it, is practical applications of games, so games used not only for entertainment but also for practical advantage.  You touched on it because you said about how puzzle games can be used with children which is already a kind of practical application.  Do you see others, or what kind of opportunities do you see?
Respondent 2: I honestly think video games has the biggest potential for revolutionising education just in general.  Especially with virtual reality coming out, I have one VR, it’s not really a game but it’s super awesome.  I put on the headset and it shows someone’s arm and I can zoom into the arm and I’m standing on the skin.  And I see little text tiles that pop up that tell me about the skin cells and stuff.  I zoom into the cell and I see mitosis and all these other processes going on.  Life size, like all around me.  It’s super interesting and it’s way more interesting than a cellular biology class, that’s for sure.  I think you gain a lot.  I mean, it’s the philosophical question, Alice in the black and white room, do you gain something by experiencing something that you wouldn’t by just reading or gathering the information?  I think you really do.
Respondent 2: That’s the one thing that video games can really give you, you get to experience the knowledge in a way that’s not really possible from a textbook or from a lecture, you get to be inside of the system that you’re trying to understand.  I think there’s a study, they compared Luminosity which was that game made by neuro-scientists or whatever to help people with memory and things like that.  They did a kind of test between people who did that and people who played Portal.
Interviewer: I think I read this study.
Respondent 2: Yeah.  And people on Portal, they had far bigger benefits than the Luminosity one.  Another one they were comparing first person shooters, Call of Duty, and peoples’ ability to distinguish between different shades of grey or count the number of moving objects.  And even playing first person shooter for an hour had a tremendous benefit which can help with driving, with reaction time.  I mean, a whole bunch of things that gaming can help you with.
Interviewer: Do you think these games can be used also in school?
Respondent 2: Yeah.  They can be used in school but it’s tricky because they have to be educational enough to play at school, but they can't be too – it can't just be a fun game, it can't be just Portal, which you’re not really – you’re getting benefits from it cognitively but you’re not actually learning about a subject.  And there’s not a lot of games that I’ve seen that have really struck that balance well and that’s a very difficult problem that’s going to take really good smart game designers to solve.
Interviewer: Are you familiar with the terms serious games and gamification?
Respondent 2: Yeah.  I can talk about that.  Gamification, this kind of goes back to what I was talking about where I haven't seen a game that really strikes the balance between education and being a game.  Playing educational games that try and gamify learning, I think they really missed the mark, because they’re not fun. (Laughs)  Which is the most important thing about a game, it has to be enjoyable.  And it’s tricky to integrate those two things together.  I mainly play serious games, really competitive or hard, difficult games.
Interviewer: Do you see ethical issues in games and gaming, but also maybe in the message they are conveying?
Respondent 2: Are you talking about maybe like portrayals of women in games or portrayal of men in games?
Interviewer: For example, yeah.
Respondent 2: Not particularly.  Because I think it’s art and I think art you have a lot of leisure and whatever the art is it’s so expressive and it’s – I mean, this is such a heavy topic, but it’s – we shouldn’t be criticising the creativity of people and the art that they make, because it’s a personal expression.  And we shouldn’t really limit their expression because of our maybe ethical or moral standings.  Even discussions with unethical people can expand your understanding of certain topics.  I’m really against that concept.  
Respondent 2: Like the women, video games have traditionally been for men, they’re transiting now which is a good trend to be more inclusive.  But the whole princess in the castle and you’re always saving the dancer in distress issue with video games is really the male power fantasy.  It’s men want to save the women and get the kiss at the end.  It’s not really a negative portrayal of women as much as it is the fantasy of men that made the video game.  
Respondent 2: I don’t really see a problem with that, I wish there was more representation of other concepts, which is happening, it’s a maturing art form, and so it’s going to start out really simplistic for technical reasons and just because it’s a new art.  We’re now getting to more serious and more rich story telling that isn't so two dimensional as it used to be.  Yeah, it’s evolving.  I don’t really see much issues in that line.
Interviewer: Do you feel the same way about the violent content of video games?
Respondent 2: No, I think people are pretty good at understanding it’s a game.  I think it’s a good way to get out violence and to wind down and if you are really angry to just shoot some Nazi zombies in the face and then you’re not as angry anymore. But I am curious to see with virtual reality, a whole new set of rules, that might change because of how immersive and how realistic it feels, or it’s going to feel.  It still feels like a game but I can see into the future and it’s going to be indistinguishable from reality within our lifetimes.  Then the question of violence is going to crop up again and I just don’t have enough data to really comment on if that’s going to be a problem.  I don’t think it’s a problem now though.
Respondent 2: Looking at some of these words, piracy.  The issue with piracy with all media content is if you make it readily available and at a fair price piracy drops.  I used to pirate movies and music all the time, I got Netflix, I got Spotify, I don’t pirate anymore, because it’s made readily available to me at a fair price.  So the need for piracy went away.  When there’s a show that I’m incapable of watching without pirating I will, like a Chinese film or something, there’s no other way to get it besides piracy.  Which is kind of a necessity in some cases if you want to get some media content.
Interviewer: So you don’t see much of an issue anymore in piracy?
Respondent 2: No.  I don’t know a lot of people who really pirate video games anymore.  I used to but with Steam and with the digital platforms that have come out it’s so trivial to get them now, the necessity for piracy has decreased significantly.
Interviewer: Something connected to that is the issue of monetisation of video games.  
Respondent 2: Actually, that’s a huge issue.  This is actually the biggest ethical issue I have.  So games like Counterstrike Go, Rocket League, they have a crate system where you play, you get a crate that has a random item in it and you buy a key which is like a dollar to unlock it.  And it’s literally a roulette of what item you’re going to get.  And there’s kids playing this and you’re teaching kids to gamble, which is highly concerning to me.  Because I mean, gambling is very addictive, it shrinks the reward centre of your brain and it is not something – I don’t think we should be teaching kids the “value” of gambling in video games, and it sucks.
"Respondent 2: But more and more game designers are doing it and it’s really, really disappointing that gaming aspect.  Micro-transactions is kind of the same thing.  It’s odd how valuable digital content can be, like there’s knives in Counterstrike Go that go for a thousand dollars.  It’s absurd, it’s a digital item, it cost zero money to produce, literally zero money to produce an infinite number of them.  Yet their artificial scarcity is causing them to have tremendous value behind them.  It’s really, really bizarre and it’s going to get worse I think which is unfortunate.  That’s probably the biggest ethical issue I think I have with games in general, is the way it’s trending towards getting money out of people is not good.  Mobile gaming is like the cesspool of this, it’s one of the reasons I don’t play mobile gaming, it’s so; give us more money, give us more money, give us more money, and I’m morally against that aspect."
Interviewer: So you said it yourself, it’s also connected to the issue of addiction, right?
Respondent 2: Yeah.  I  mean, it’s a huge problem to get people addicted to spending money like that.  I don’t support it.  
Interviewer: Another topic is the most abstract question I will ask of you, how do you see the influence of games on society?  Do you think they influence society?  And if so, how?
Respondent 2: Yeah, that’s tough.  I need to sit and think for a second about that one.
Interviewer: Take your time.
Respondent 2: One part that I touched on before is definitely the social aspect of it.  I’ve been connected to people who live in very remote places, in Europe and Canada and other places I’ve never even been, and I’ve developed friendships with people that I’ve never seen or met.  And I think social media is too, but to be connected with people from such varying backgrounds I think is definitely a positive.  And it’s interesting to have friends that you’ve never seen their face, it’s definitely an odd experience.  Beyond that, I think there’s tremendous potential for games to be beneficial to society.  I’m not an expert in analysing that information so I don’t know if they’ve really had a positive impact.  Going back to problem solving distilled and teaching people really core concepts of how to solve problems.  
Respondent 2: And also how to – this is a little bit off topic for games in society, this goes back to the first thought, but I just thought about it and I think it’s an important part of it.  Games is the only media I can think of that requires you to be good at it, otherwise you don’t get the content.  Just because you bought a game doesn’t mean you get the full content.  If you’re not good enough at the game you don’t get to see all of the content.  And that’s a very important lesson for peoples’ lives.  You don’t read a book and then halfway through the book it gives you a quiz and if you fail the quiz the book slams shut and you can't read any further.  Or a movie where, what’s that character’s name?  You don’t know?  Back to the beginning of the movie.  
Respondent 2: This doesn’t happen in any other media but video games.  That trial and error and that difficulty in restricting the content based on your skill level I think is very beneficial lessons to people that they can then apply to their day to day lives, which kind of goes back to society.  I think that’s probably as much as I can say about that because I don’t really know the impact that games has on society, so it’s hard for me to speak on that subject.
Interviewer: A thing you already said is that you consider games a form or art, right?
Respondent 2: Yeah.
Interviewer: It’s something that is very widely debated if they can be art or not.  So it’s interesting that you have a very clear position on that.
Respondent 2: Oh, games are absolutely art.  I always laugh at the people who say games aren’t art.  It’s a very silly and narrow definition of art, especially when we live in a time with post modernism and where art can be so abstract and so much is considered art but they exclude games.  I think that’s a pretty silly position to take.
Interviewer: A thing I’m interested about is regulating the use of games because before you talked about children playing video games and how this can be especially dangerous for them if they are gambling.  What do you think about how video games are regulated?  So for example, the rating system to say this game shouldn’t be played by people under sixteen or eighteen?
Respondent 2: The rating system is there, I don’t know how much it’s followed.  If it’s present and it’s not followed it’s not really useful.  I don’t really know how many parents are following, I know my parents didn’t really care about the rating system.  I don’t know many – when I was a kid I didn’t know many parents that really cared about that either.  If it’s there but it’s not being used it doesn’t really matter.  As far as regulating other parts, we have to be careful with any regulation, you have to be really – just because your intentions are good and you want a positive outcome doesn’t mean that the regulations you’re going to put in place are a) going to make that true, and b) aren’t going to have really negative unintended consequences.  
Respondent 2: The biggest thing I would regulate in video games is the gambling aspect of it.  It’s gambling and I think it should be regulated as if it was gambling, because it’s what it is (laughs).  If you want to go really deep into the – so there’s regulations on like child pornography video games, things like that.  And that comes up with a really difficult moral argument, where if that stops paedophiles from having sex with kids because they have this digital outlet to it, should we be regulating that?  I don’t know the answer to that, that’s something that has to be studied and researched.  It’s already against the law so they’ve made up their mind.  But if it true that it would decrease the amount of abuse for people who are neurologically paedophilic then those games probably should be allowed, because it protects children in a way.  
Respondent 2: But it’s such a moral grey area, you got to be so careful with regulation.  Because it might be a good intention, let’s not have video games with this explicit content in it but has the unintended consequence on making sexual abuse of minors more prevalent because they don’t have that release that they could otherwise be getting from video games.  You can take that and abstract it to as many subjects as you want to with violence, people who have violent tendencies, video games are a good release to that.  Does that decrease their level of violence?  I don't know.  I know there’s been some studies, I don’t remember them well enough to quote so I’m not going to.  
Respondent 2: But at the same time you’re giving them the virtual experience and the question is, are those experiences of violence or explicit behaviours, is that immoral to even experience it, or is it really the act upon the other individual that’s the immoral aspect of it that needs to be – that’s a tough question (laughs).  It requires a lot of research and intelligent implementation of these regulations.  I don’t really have faith in government to really do the research or be – I still don’t think government is really data driven so I’m kind of on the whole against regulation, but it’s mainly just my lack of faith in the people who are making the regulations to be able to do it from a scientific data driven perspective.
Interviewer: Another thing I wanted to ask, you said you just bought a virtual reality headset.  I’m interested in what you think of the future of games, also virtual reality, how do you think they will change if there are new opportunities presented by this technological innovation?
Respondent 2: Yeah.  I mean, the question is really difficult because it’s not so much – because what’s important to measure is not really the change but the rate of change, the delta change.  The rate of change is so high and so insane that even predicting ten years out of what video games are going to look like is extremely difficult.  There’s Moore’s laws but there is some really interesting research that’s being done that could really surpass Moore’s law.  Google just came out yesterday and announced a screen that had ten times the pixel density of any screen before it.  And it’s going to be close to – when they’re talking about specifically putting in a virtual reality headset which they’ve done, and they said they’re approaching the point where it’s indistinguishable from reality, already, today.  They’re already getting to that level of fidelity which is unbelievable.  
Respondent 2: I don’t know if you’ve read the book Ready Player One which directly deals with this concept of virtual reality in the future where it becomes indistinguishable from reality and it’s a better reality because it’s designed by humans than what we live in now.  So people retreat to it because it’s a fun awesome reality where you’re the hero and life isn't like that.  Movies are great because it shows this reality that’s so captivating and interesting because it was made by humans for humans.  And if we create a whole universe of these different realities why would you choose the real one when you have this compelling experience that’s always there and always available to you.  It’s going to be a very difficult problem for us to overcome.  
Respondent 2: This goes to more of a deeper thing where more abstractly the concept of reality itself is going to be deeply challenged in the next couple of decades of what is real and what isn't real.  And we’re going to – what matters is the subject of reality, the experience or reality, and we’re going to open the gateway to things that aren’t possible in the real life are now possible in an experiential way where your brain – what’s that experiment where we’re all just brains in vats experiencing this reality.  That’s literally going to be true very soon.  And you could spend your whole life where every time you say fireball and you put your hand out a fireball pops into existence and flies forward.  That’s your V-reality that you experience is where magic is real.  What does that do to the human psyche or your experience, is that a good experience?  What’s the moral values of that?  I have no idea.  It’s going to be exciting, I’m ready to get on that rollercoaster but the greater impact that that’s going to have on people, I can't say.
Interviewer: I see what you mean.  So you think it’s going to be in some ways a problem.
Respondent 2: I don't know if it’s a problem, that’s – I mean, there’s another thought experiment where you could – it’s the experience machine where you could live your whole life in this fake world and it’s incredibly satisfying, it makes you incredibly happy, or you could spend your whole life in the real world with all of its problems and issues that you’re facing.  If you choose to live in the fake world is that life any less valuable than the life that was lived in the “real world”.  I don’t really think there would be a meaningful difference from the perspective of the person which is really what matters.  Is there a moral issue there or is there a problem with living your life in a completely virtual environment which is something we’re going to face in our lifetime, a hundred percent sure.  I don’t know if there is a problem with living your life entirely virtually.  Maybe, but I’m not really seeing the issue there.
Interviewer: Going to the last topic actually of the interview.  We talked about a lot of things about games, potential problems, potential opportunities.  What advice would you give to different categories of people who interact with games to make the future better for games and for gaming?  I don't know if I explained myself well.
Respondent 2: I know what you mean, I’m just thinking.  I mean, educators, I feel like our school system – I’m in America, I don’t know about over there but our school system is not very game friendly in any way, shape or form.  I think that’s a big problem.  I think they really need to start – because there’s so much tremendous opportunity there, they really need to start investing in those kind of experiments.  I know they’re starting to use Minecraft which is fantastic.  I’m a computer science major, when I was in college Minecraft came out and there’s – I don’t know if you know about Redstone and how that works in it, but it’s computer engineering, it’s making circuits.  And I was able to understand computers at a fundamental level by playing with the circuitry in Minecraft.  That was very beneficial.  
Respondent 2: I think educators really need to start taking a serious look at the benefits that they can get from video games.  As far as developers, they need to work with educators in a way to – I mentioned this before, I’ve not had a compelling experience where that was both highly educational and highly fun at the same time.  There’s a big gap there that needs to be bridged.  I think there needs to be a collaborative effort between game studies and teachers and educators.  
Respondent 2: Researchers, the research I have read on video games seems to be pretty good.  Parents, they need to know what video games their children are playing.  That is the most important thing and I think they should play video games with their kids.  They need to understand the experiences that their kids are getting and they need to be – if you play games with your kids you get this beautifully shared experience with them that is – it’s like playing backyard football with your parents and your brothers and family or whatever, it’s a great bonding experience.  I think parents are pretty dismissive of video games these days, which is unfortunate.  I think they should be embracing them and experiencing them with their children, because there are so much benefits that come from there.
Respondent 2: Players, don’t play so many video games, take a break, walk away.  Go outside, see the sun.  That’s huge.  Exercise.  It’s so easy to get sucked down the rabbit hole of addiction with video games, you have to have the discipline to stop.  And that’s something that wasn’t instilled in me as an adolescent and it’s something that as an adult I had to come to terms with and get out of those bad habits.  I still fall into it every now and again playing too many games, but it was not easy to come out of the heavy addiction of video games.  It’s challenging.  I don’t really know what can be done to make that better but I know like South Korea has video game addiction clinics to get people off it, but they have a very unique culture in video games so it’s slightly different.
Interviewer: Anything about institutions, so the government for example?  Because you mentioned them before and said they’re not really data driven, and so you don’t have much confidence in what they are going to do.
Respondent 2: Yeah, I would prefer they wouldn't do anything because I just don’t trust them.  That’s a whole issue.  I feel like every aspect of our society is knocking it out of the park except for government.  Every other aspect, we’re doing so good, and then government is just such a letdown, it’s very disappointing.  They just don’t care about facts, it seems like, or truth, and that’s the only thing that matters is the facts and the truth and the data.  But it seems like they’re so driven by emotion and what they feel like and corruption and lots of other issues, but yeah, I don’t have much faith in the government’s ability to regulate video games in an intelligent way.
Interviewer: Is there anything you want to add we didn’t touch on, some thoughts that came up when we were talking about something else?
Respondent 2: I think I covered all my bases pretty good (laughs), it was a pretty wide conversation.  
Interviewer: I guess the interview is over.  It was a little faster than I expected but it’s very dense.  So thank you.

Interview 3:
Interviewer: Okay.  I will share a window.  You should be able to see it even if I don't share my video, right?
Respondent 3: Oh yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.  So I will explain to you how this interview works.  As I said, we're interested in your experience as a gamer and what you think the influence of games is on society.  Along the way, we will use these slides I'm sharing to help us guide our conversation on several topics we're interested in.
Respondent 3: Okay.
Interviewer: So for example, I will share with you some key words.  You are free to use them or not use them.  You are not required to touch on all of them, but you can use them as cues to shape your thoughts about something.  Okay?
Respondent 3: Okay.
Interviewer: And we will start from your personal experience and then we will try to move on to a more abstract level, and if you don't have any questions—  Do you have any questions?
Respondent 3: No, not yet.
Interviewer: Okay.  So we can begin, and we will begin by asking you about your experience with games.  So, what do you play, for how long do you play, etcetera?
Respondent 3: For how long, like from what age?
Interviewer: Yeah.
Respondent 3: Yeah, okay, because I started playing, I guess, when I was about eleven years old, because I was always bored because they were doing renovations in a house.  I started with the Game Boy, Pokémon Blue, but my real actual gaming career actually started when I was sixteen because I got a PlayStation 3 then, and that's my main platform.  Yeah well, now it's a PlayStation 4, of course.  So yeah, that would be what I'm doing the most.
Respondent 3: I play every week, especially at night, after dinner when I'm done with my work.  I think I play a diverse collection of games actually.  My favourite series of games are Assassin's Creed, Kingdom Hearts, and Uncharted, so I play them a lot.
Interviewer: I don't know the last one, but I know the others.
Respondent 3: Uncharted?  It's a shame because it's a really good game.
Interviewer: (Laughs) 
Respondent 3: I mainly play the single player campaigns because I don't like multiplayer.  It's too competitive, I guess.  My PlayStation name is [anonymised], so it's pretty clear that I'm a girl when I'm playing online.  Sometimes when I head shot another guy, then I hear them cursing through my headphones because they know they've been defeated by a girl.
Interviewer: (Laughs) 
Respondent 3: So I think that's funny, but I don't really like the experience of multiplayer gaming a lot.  I'm also the only one in my family who really games, so it's not like they can—  Or even among my friends I'm the only one, so they don't come over to play games.  So it's mostly just me playing games.
Interviewer: Okay.  Do you play on a mobile too, or just a PlayStation?
Respondent 3: Yeah, just a PlayStation.
Interviewer: Okay.  And if you don't mind me asking – you can choose not to answer me – but how much do you spend on games?
Respondent 3: How much money do I spend?  Well, it's actually difficult now because I'm a member of the PlayStation Network.  I have that subscription, so for sixty euros a year you get two free games a month.  So I don't spend a lot of money anymore, unless there's another game that I really want and I can order it, like from the main series I just mentioned.  Then I dare to give, well, sixty euros for a new game.  But that doesn't happen a lot.
Interviewer: Okay.  The next thing I want to ask you, which is already a little more difficult question, is what effect do you think games have on you and on other people?  So you've been playing for a long time, so do you think games have changed you, in a way?
Respondent 3: Hmm, well, it highly depends, of course, on what game you're playing.  I think first person shooters, I never thought of them having an effect on me.  They can be kind of aggressive, but I can really – I don't know – separate that from real life.  So I've never noticed an effect from them.  I noticed maybe the biggest change from strategy games because they really make you think and I become sharper when playing them and I learn their system.  I already have [Portal] and it's like you learn a new way of thinking, thinking with [portals].  
Respondent 3: So I think that's the main effect I have from games.  Otherwise, it's just like watching a movie.  I mean, I can be really emotionally moved by games, but when I stop playing them, it's not like they have a real lasting effect on me.
Interviewer: Okay.  One thing I would be interested in is you said when you play strategy games you feel sharper.
Respondent 3: Yes.
Interviewer: Do you think this is also an ability you can use outside the gaming context, or just for that particular context?
Respondent 3: No, I definitely think that I—  Yeah, I learn some things from games, like the other ways of thinking, and also – what do you call it? – spatial thinking.  I got better at that by playing games, definitely.  
Respondent 3: Yeah, I think games make you do things that aren't necessarily fun in real life but, because there's a goal in the game, in the original story, you kind of want to do them, and so it trains abilities, yeah, definitely.  It's hard to find an example, that's why I'm thinking, but I really believe it has that affect on me.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, okay.  Do you think, personally, that games can be addictive?
Respondent 3: Yeah, I definitely think they can be, but I've never noticed that with the PlayStation games I play.  I did have that with some of the mobile games because they're really made to make you addicted, I think.  They have the system of experience points and, yeah (laughs) it's really ridiculous because, in my eyes, they aren't even real games.  But still, they make you come back for more experience or more money.  So yeah, they definitely have that addicted effect.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, okay.  You already touched on the competitive side of online gaming.  Did you also ever play collaborative online games?
Respondent 3: Yeah.  I mean, in Uncharted, for example, there's also a multiplayer mode in which you have to collaborate and play against the computer.  I tend to get stressed by missions like that because I don't want to be bad.  I mean, the word 'new' is used a lot in multiplayer gaming and I really hate that, so I tend to actually not play a lot of collaborative games.
Interviewer: Okay.  So you mostly play single player also because when you're in a collaborative situation you still feel pressure, right?
Respondent 3: Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.  The third thing I wanted to ask is if you know or can think of some practical applications of video games.  So, using games not only for entertainment but also for other purposes.
Respondent 3: Well I mean, there's a lot of thought about gamification, of course, like planning of your next weeks and things you have to do when you make a game out of it, if you are able to do them, but I'm not sure that's a real game.  That's just trying to make something a game.  But I am thinking about augmented reality games, like, of course, Pokémon Go, also Run, Zombies Run, and I think they are really effective in actually activating people to do some physical activities.
Respondent 3: So yeah, I think that that's the main thing that games can actually—  Of course, I was also talking about the puzzle games that can actually make you learn stuff without you knowing it.  That was actually really big when I was little.  When I was like, I don't know, seven/eight years old, I discovered a computer and my dad gave me a lot of games, and I still, today, know a lot of things I learnt from those games, just about history and about geography.  And at the time, I didn't know I was learning because, otherwise, I wouldn't have played them, probably.
Interviewer: (Laughs) 
Respondent 3: So yeah, they definitely work.
Interviewer: Did you play them at school or were the games played on your own?
Respondent 3: No, at home.
Interviewer: Okay.  Do you think they could be used in schools?
Respondent 3: Definitely, yeah.  I know a few of my teachers actually tried to play some educational games in school, but they were the wrong games.  They were games you knew were made to educate you and they didn't feel immersive at all.  The games I got from my father when I was little, they looked colourful.  They were just games and you played through them, but they had these hidden things in them that suddenly started to teach you about art and history, and I just missed that.  
Respondent 3: So yeah, I think that the wrong thing with those games in school was that they were made for education, and not for fun.  So they really missed that fun aspect.
Interviewer: Okay.  So you mean those kinds of games should be designed with entertainment as a first goal, right?
Respondent 3: Yeah, I think so, because if the entertainment isn't there, children know that they are learning and then they just stop playing.  Well, that was my experience at least.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, okay.  Coming back on gamification, which you said you are familiar with, did you have any personal experience with gamification?  Have you ever used gamified systems?
Respondent 3: Not a lot of them, actually.  I know of this app where you can actually put in what you have to do in the next week, I think, and it gives you experience points if you actually succeed in doing them, but it was too much of a hassle.  It just (laughs)—  Yeah, I didn't use it all.  I thought it was a great idea, but it didn't work for me.
Interviewer: Okay.  Moving on to a workforce topic, do you see any potential ethical issues in games, both in their development and in the message they're conveying?
Respondent 3: Yeah, I mean, people always talk about violence in games, but like I said, I can really separate them from real life.  So I think that, in games, of course you can be very violent in first person shooters, but that doesn't really say anything about your real behaviour.
Respondent 3: My main problem with games is probably sexism.  When I'm playing them, I realise that a lot of games are not made for girls and they can really take you out of it sometimes.  I was talking about Uncharted, and I really love that series, but you play as the male, Drake, in those games.  And I remember at one point it was a really immersive point in the story because you've just had this huge fight and then you have to climb up this ladder, and Drake's girlfriend climbs up the ladder first and the camera kind of pans into her and you see her butt.
Interviewer: (Laughs) 
"Respondent 3: And Drake, the player I'm supposed to be, comments, ""Oh, it's such a shame you have to sit on that.""  And I didn't like that at all because that's not something I would say.  So I was taking completely out of the character.  I wasn't Drake anymore at that point.  It's like, why is he saying that?"
Interviewer: (Laughs) 
Respondent 3: So yeah, those are offensive [0:15:21] things that aren't really meant for women, I think.  So yeah, there are a lot of issues like that.
Interviewer: I'd like to explore this topic a little more because, actually, we mostly have interviewed males, so we don't (laughs)—
Respondent 3: Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: I would like to take this opportunity to know a little bit more about what features of a game makes you say this is designed for a male and not for a female.
Respondent 3: Well, there's of course—
Interviewer: You said about this bad service but is there any other [0:16:09]?
Respondent 3: Well, just the narrative is often also focused on male characters.  They are the heroes.  The females are put in the games to be saved.  And, of course, there are a lot of games that try to change that and have these strong female protagonists, but then you start playing the game and you again realise that you are looking at bouncing boobies and her butt the entire time.  The female characters in games, they just scream when they jump.  No male character does that.
Interviewer: (Laughs) 
"Respondent 3: It's like strange differences.  Males have this full-on armour and females have this bikini armour and stuff like that.  But actually, it's not only the games; it's also the multiplayer community.  Like I said, I was stupid enough to have my PSN name as [anonymised], so everyone knows I'm a girl, and every time I do play multiplayer – like I said, I don't do that a lot, but every time I do – I get an instant friend request with some guy asking me, ""Are you a gamer girl?""  And that's so unnecessary (laughs).  It's like, yeah, you know that because I play the game.  It's so weird that they want to contact you."
"Respondent 3: I know one time I got a message saying, ""I bet you are really sexy.""  I was like, what!"
Interviewer: (Laughs) 
Respondent 3: What's that about?  Really strange.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, okay.  I don't know, but do you frequent forums, communities of gamers?  Do you feel there is the same dynamic there?
Respondent 3: I don't frequent a lot of them.  It's mostly when I'm really into a game that I look it up on the internet and see what other people say about it.  I mean, mostly I see people not having the same issues with the game that I have because I think the forums – I don't know because they are usernames and I don't know their gender – but I think most of the people on the forums are also male.
Respondent 3: What I see most on the internet when I look up games is people playing it much more competitively than I am, talking about strategies to become better, and that's not what I do at all.  I frequent the forums of Pokémon Go now and I see people constantly talking about the [0:19:01] system and fighting with Pokémon, while I'm just interested in filling out my Pokédex.  It's really strange for me that the focus is entirely different, but Pokémon does have all the female players, so that's… well, that's a good thing.
Interviewer: Were there any games that gave you the opposite impression?  I mean, okay, this is a game that is well designed for women.
Respondent 3: I'm now playing Mass Effect Andromeda and I'm kind of pleased with it.  Until now, I haven't played a lot of it, but you can design your own female character, and she's a real character.  I mean, you have those games where you have these clear male protagonists and then a rip-off female.  Like Zelda is doing that now, and now there's suddenly Linkle.  Even her name is derived from the male characters.  
Respondent 3: So, in Mass Effect, you really have these female protagonists, and she's made like that.  And I've heard that a lot of male gamers actually also play as a female, of course, but I feel like you can really customise her the way you want to.  So you're not pushed into these sexist schemes or something like that.  So I feel like, up till now, it's doing a good job.
Interviewer: Okay.  Still talking about the portrayal of diversity of people, do you also think that games are designed for white people, to be blunt (laughs)?  Do you think there is also a problem in the portrayal of race, as well as gender?
Respondent 3: Yeah, I definitely think so.  It's hard for me to tell because it's just—  Well, it's horrible to say, but I think I never really think about that when playing.  But if you reflect on it, yes, definitely.
Respondent 3: Mass Effect also does a good job with that because you can actually choose everything, your skin colour, your race, whatever, at the beginning of the game.  So you can really customise your character, and there are also black characters in the game.  But often some games have this black character, you know, this token black character because they didn't have any and, oh damn, we have to put one in.  So yeah, I think a lot of games are actually, yeah, quite white minded.
Interviewer: Okay.  And moving on to a completely different topic, what do you think about those kinds of games that—  How can I say?  Let's start over.  In traditional games, you buy the game and then you have the game and you don't spend a single coin on it anymore.  But more and more recently, there have been games based on a subscription system or games that are free and then you buy inside them, objects or advantages.  What do you think about that?  Have you ever played these kinds of games?
Respondent 3: Yeah.  I mean, yeah, I've played mobile games and they all have that.  It's kind of pay-to-win.  I make it kind of an honourable thing to not give any money to those games and still be good at them.  What I'm most frustrated about is PlayStation give you a game and then ask you to pay for the [0:22:54], even if you've paid sixty euros for the game.  I think that's really horrible and, I mean, it can maybe even stop me from buying a game if I know that I have to pay a lot of extra money to get the entire game.
Respondent 3: So yeah, I tend to only give money for games and not for anything extra in them because I really think that's something—  Yeah, it's getting bigger and bigger and I really don't like that evolution in this.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  Connected to this, what do you think about pirating video games?
Respondent 3: Yeah, to be honest, I'd probably do it myself if I was a computer gamer, but I'm a PlayStation player, so I can't.  It's pretty horrible, and I know it is, but I can say I'd probably do it myself, so—
Interviewer: (Laughs) Okay.
Respondent 3: But I don't do it because I'm a PlayStation gamer.
Interviewer: I think it's possible.  It's probably more difficult, but—
Respondent 3: Yeah, but then you have to use an emulator or something, and I don't do that because that's not the same experience.
Interviewer: Hmm, okay.  Moving on to the more abstract question, I would say, of the interview, which is do you believe that games have an influence on society?  Do you see an influence on society by games?  And if so, which kind of influence?
Respondent 3: Hmm, I think that's a hard one.  I immediately actually think, again, of Pokémon Go because that had a huge impact, I think, on society.  There were parks where no one ever came in Belgium, and suddenly they were full of people, people who didn't even know each other, talking to each other and asking which Pokémon they had spotted and stuff like that.  So I thought that was wonderful.  But once the hype was over, that was over as well.  So it's not really a lasting effect.  Another funny thing I thought was that Pokémon Go measures in kilometres and not in feet or whatever, so a lot of American people actually got to know kilometres.
Interviewer: (Laughs) Okay.
Respondent 3: And I thought that was a wonderful impact of Pokémon Go (laughs).  
Respondent 3: But yeah, I mean, really lasting effects, well, I don't know.  Well, maybe multiplayer gaming can have a more lasting effect.  But on society as a whole?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm a single player and it's just me sitting on a couch playing games, so it's hard to say that that has an impact.  
Respondent 3: But I suppose there are games, like Journey, that after I played that game, I had such a positive outlook on life because it's maybe the most wonderful collaborative game.  As I said, I don't play collaborative games because they put pressure on me.  Journey didn't do that at all.  It was like I played that game and, after finishing it, I felt faith in humanity was restored.  But again, does it have an effect on society?  How many people have played that game and does it actually impact them in their real life?  I don't know.  It's hard to say.
Interviewer: Hmm, hm-hm.  One thing I would like to ask you is do you think games can be art or artful?
"Respondent 3: Yeah.  Yeah, they can definitely be artful.  I think so.  But they are so different from the art we know, I think, that it's a hard—  Because a lot of games, their art is not in the specific actions of a player, or even the things you see on screen, but it's about the whole of the experience.  And that's difficult to explain to people.  It's like a story and the way you are immersed in it; it's an experience.  I think people find it hard to accept that art is like this experience [package 0:27:47].  So, yeah."
"Respondent 3: Of course, there are a lot of art forms, like pixel art, that also derived from games, and they are accepted more, I think.  Maybe because it's just something visual, like objects you can look at, so people say, ""Oh yeah, that's art.""  But the games, yeah, it's more like – I don't know what you call it – experience art [0:28:13].  But yeah, it's the whole package of the game that you have to see, and a lot of people don't."
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  Were there any games that gave you this impression that you've played?
Respondent 3: Well, yeah, Journey.  Like I was saying, the whole experience of sharing those travels with another player, you don't even know who he is and you don't have a way of communicating, except through these symbols and making sounds.  It's just the whole dynamic of that game, and it's beautifully made, but I wouldn't say that a screenshot from the game is art.  It's just really, yeah, the entire time playing that counts as art for me.
Interviewer: Okay.  Another thing I wanted to ask, you talked before about augmented reality, and I would also say virtual reality is growing as a new technology in games.  How do you think it is affecting games and will affect the games?  Do you think it will change the way games are experienced?
Respondent 3: Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I've only tried virtual reality in Geneva back then, and it was such a different experience than anything I'd had before because it kind of deceives all your senses.  You really have a feeling that you're in this room and that you're somewhere where you're not.  
Respondent 3: If the quality of games can be like they are now on the screen but in virtual reality, I think it's going to be ridiculous how that it's going to be an artful experience.  I mean, you can really play someone in another world and you can even use it to—  I mean, we saw in Geneva also – this is really all I know about – [0:30:21] and, yeah, it's going to be a revolution, I think, not only in gaming but also how it's going to be used in every aspect of human life if [0:30:37].
Interviewer: Okay.  The—
Respondent 3: I think that for most people, if you haven't tried virtual reality, I think you don't get that.  But if you really stand there and see it for yourself, it's like, wow.
Interviewer: (Laughs) I remember it from Geneva too.  I was (laughs) very impressed.
Respondent 3: Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: Another thing I want to touch on about this topic is what do you think about regulating the use of games?  By 'regulating', I mean both from governments – so for example, saying that this game cannot be sold to people under-eighteen – and by parents regulating the use of games for their children.
Respondent 3: Yeah, I think it's kind of important.  I know when I was sixteen I'd already played some games that were, I think, over-eighteen rated, because my parents never really looked at that, and I think I was shocked by some of the things, especially sexual things in games.  I think it's important to let people know that there are age restrictions on games, and, from the parenting perspective, I think it's important not only to follow those government rules but also to make sure that little children don't play games too often.  Playing outside is an important aspect of being a little kid and you have to make sure your kid isn't watching a screen the entire time.  That's not only bad for their eyes, but also for their development, I think.  So yeah, I think there is some responsibility there.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, okay.  This is actually the last question of the interview, which is what kind of advice would you give to different people who are involved with games in one way or another?  What kind of advice would you give to make the situation better or better apply video games?
"Respondent 3: Yeah, [I see the word 0:33:05] educators and I think it's important that games are, like I said, fun and entertainment games.  So if you want to teach something to a gamer, don't make that the first goal of the game because people and children will realise.  So always have a good concept, a fictional world, a story, or whatever, to embed the educational aspect of the game.  I think that's really important.  The same thing in schools; if you want to teach children through games, make them fun."
Respondent 3: Well, to developers, of course, try to focus on the female perspective also and maybe—  I don't know how it actually is in the development world.  Is there a much larger group of male developers there also?  I guess so.
Interviewer: I think so.  Yeah, I think so.
Respondent 3: Yeah.  So try to have more female developers.  I'm sure that's going to help.  
Respondent 3: Yeah, we've talked about parents, so, yeah.
Respondent 3: What is the word 'institutions' there?
Interviewer: Yeah, I mean, if you think the government should do something, you know, a regulation by law, I'd say.
Respondent 3: I don't know a lot about that, but isn't that already quite on point with the age restriction system and stuff like that?  Because I don't really know what they can do more.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, okay.  As far as I know, that's the only restriction they put.  So there is no restriction, for example, on content.  I mean, you could have a game on any kind of content and the worst that you could get is that people under-eighteen, I think, could play it.  But there have been some controversial games in terms of content.
Respondent 3: Yeah.
Interviewer: I think, especially about violent content, there have been some controversial games.  But you said before that you think that you yourself, and people in general, are able to differentiate between game and reality.
Respondent 3: Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  I was talking about shooters back then, but I'm thinking now (laughs) that I don't think I could ever play or even see someone play a rape game or something.  I don't see how that can have any good effect right now.  So yeah, I guess there are some restrictions on content in my head (laughs).
Respondent 3: I'm also very bad with violence in games because I get nauseous quite fast.  I played God of War and there's this one point where – I don't know – you have to rip out eyes and stuff like that.  It's very hard for me to play that, especially as God of War has this tendency to change to first-person when you have to do the most violent things.  I really had a hard time doing those things.  I didn't like it all.  I know a lot of people actually buy the game for that, so it's hard to say they have to change the content because, I mean, it sells, apparently, but I do have some trouble with that.
Interviewer: Okay.  Is there anything you want to add that maybe you thought about and didn't know when to say it, or something we didn't touch on?
Respondent 3: I don't know.  I don't think I have.  I mean, I have a lot to say about video games, but I just can't think of something that should be helpful right now.  
Respondent 3: Maybe there are a lot of games, and because we talked about the ethical aspect of games, there are a lot of games that have this moral system incorporated in them.  I think that they're beginning to get better at it, but in the past it was always this really clear choice between good and bad, and without a lot of freedom.  A lot of times there were only two choices.  So it's strange that a lot of people [0:38:23] that moral system, whereas it's really just the game making you choose things that don't even matter for the story a lot of the time, or to develop the character.  It's hard to call that a moral system.
Respondent 3: So maybe I think that if games were to be educational, because they can be, I think, on the moral part, then they have to be able to give you more freedom and give choices that actually make sense.  For example, your character must always be—  I mean, it must also be a possibility to do nothing at all, for example.  And I think, again, Mass Effect is on the right track for that.
Respondent 3: So yeah, I feel, up to now, games can't really be said to have a moral system.  It's too simple for that.  Yeah, make the moral choices actually count and make sense, and then maybe it will be truly moral.
Interviewer: I actually think this is becoming a selling point of some games (laughs).
Respondent 3: Yeah.  Yeah, sure.
Interviewer: That they are difficult moral choices.
"Respondent 3: This is really weird (laughs).  I mean, a lot of games are always centred on that.  I mean, I'm thinking about Life is Strange, which is a horrible game because it makes you choose things and then immediately you see some of the consequences of your actions.  It then asks, like, ""Is that really what you want to do?""  (Laughs)  So I'm just constantly rewinding in that game to see what my other actions would be, but then there are long-term consequences of your actions that you can't know yet.  So I think that game is also really on the right track by just showing you it's not that simple.  So, yeah."
Interviewer: Yeah.  I actually played that game fairly recently and I remember that the game was – I don't know – there was a lot of talk about its portrayal of young women.  I think it's considerate and pretty good in that regard.
Respondent 3: Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, I was surprised that the protagonist is really just a girl and nothing more.  It's just a girl, not sexualised or anything.  I played three episodes of it, I think, so yeah, I think they're doing a good job.  Also, she's studying art or something.  It's really cool that they represent normal student life.  Not normal at all, of course.
Interviewer: Yeah, apart from the super-powers (laughs).
Respondent 3: Yeah (laughs).  So yeah, it's still just a girl living her life and then this thing happens and you have to deal with that.  Yeah, I think they did a really good job because, before Life is Strange, I know the game Gone Home achieved a lot of grace, and I tried to play that game and I really liked the idea, but it wasn't fun for me.  
Respondent 3: I mean, there was this story and you played it and it was really deep and emotional and everything, but it wasn't fun to play that game.  You were just walking around and, okay, discovering stuff, but it didn't keep me entertained enough to actually—  But I mean, I'm not a fan of walking simulators, so yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.  Anything else?
Respondent 3: Not that I can think of right now, no.
Interviewer: Okay.  Then I will finish the interview and thank you a lot for your time.

Interview 4:
Interviewer: So we're interviewing different people that are different stakeholders in the gaming world, the gaming community.  So we've got people who are players, we've got researchers, we've got game developers, policymakers, and so forth, and we're interviewing each of these different groups, people from these different groups, to get an idea of their sort of approach to games, their attitudes, their ideas, their vision of games, specifically their own sphere or personal realm of activity and also in society in general.  Okay?
Respondent 4: All right.  Okay, hm-hm.
Interviewer: So we're doing the interviews, then these will be transcribed and analysed, and then we'll be publishing a report.  I'll tell you a little bit more about that perhaps at the end of the interview.
Respondent 4: All right.  Okay, hm-hm.
Interviewer: So how we'll work it is this, is that in the project there have been some general themes that have come up as part of the earlier work we've done, so I'm going to ask you some questions that are sort of around those themes.  Okay?
Respondent 4: Hm-hm.  Yeah, okay.
Interviewer: Now, to do that, to help me with that, each time I'm going to put up a slide, okay, and you'll see the theme, and then we'll talk a bit about it.  And then when we've talked a bit about that, I'm going to show you a second slide which will have some key words on it.  
Interviewer: Now, these are key words related to that theme that have come up in the project.  So we'll look at those together and you can see if we've already discussed them, if there are others there that we haven't discussed, or if you want to add something on the basis of these key words.  Okay?
Respondent 4: Okay, sure.
Interviewer: So we'll do that.  Anyway, I'll tell you each time that I put up a new slide for a new thing and, yeah, as far as the interview goes, just totally relaxed.  It's not a sort of journalistic interview, so you can take as much time as you like to think about what you want to say.  Okay?
Respondent 4: Okay.  All right, sure.
Interviewer: You can change your mind, you can ask me questions, ask for an explanation.  If you want, you can also decide you don't want to answer a question, or if you don't want to talk about something, that's fine as well.  And when we've finished, at the end of the interview you'll also have a little bit of time to comment about what we've said or also about the interview itself, if you like.  Okay?
Respondent 4: Okay.  Hm-hm, sure.
Interviewer: So, basically that's it.  So I'll just put up the screen share now, so you should hopefully be able to see the slide.  Can you see it now?  Hang on a sec, it might be coming through now.
Respondent 4: Yeah, I can see it now: You and Games.
Interviewer: Yeah, okay.  Okay, so we can start now.  So yes, I just want to know a little bit about you and games.  So perhaps if you could begin by introducing yourself – so, saying who you are, how old you are, where you're from, what you do, and so forth – and then tell us a little bit about your experience with digital games.  We're thinking more in terms of digital games for these interviews.  Okay?
Respondent 4: Okay.  Perfect.  So I'm [anonymised].  I'm from India and I'm twenty-seven years old.  Right now, I'm a PhD researcher in the University of Genoa.  So my research involves exploitation of [0:04:59] to enhance green driving behaviours.  So we try to bring out green driving behaviour through games and things like that, but predominately it's to promote gaming in the [automotive sector 0:05:16].  So that was the main concept.  
Respondent 4: We try to teach some sort of green and safe driving methodologies, and to expand it a little bit.  So this was the main theme and, yeah, we have been through some initial tests and things like that to acquire some data to analyse how users can get ready to use games in the automotive sector.  So that was the main idea and this [0:05:46].
Respondent 4: Personally, my exposure towards games is, some three or four years ago, I was a gamer.  I used to game frequently.  I followed some action games, such as [0:06:00], Call of Duty, and things like that.  But later, what happened was I had to change my system, so then I hadn't got the proper chance to play games as I used to play on a Windows PC.  So that's why, now, I'm not a frequent PC gamer, but instead I used to check out some mobile games.  So yeah, that is how—  But personally, I'm more towards action games.
Interviewer: Action games, that's your area.
Respondent 4: Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: Your genre of game play.
Respondent 4: Yeah, I [0:06:36] strategy or something, but I would prefer an action game with open [0:06:44].
Interviewer: Action games.
Respondent 4: Like where you are allowed to do anything and it doesn't have some strict boundaries which you have to follow.  You'll have a mission, but then you're on your own and it's absolutely open which you can explore [0:06:56] and also move forward to complete the mission, these games just interest me.
Interviewer: Okay.  So it's this quality of openness and freedom and agency that attracts you in these games?
Respondent 4: Exactly, yeah.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, I see.  You were saying you have transited a bit from desktop PC games to more mobile games.  Have you found that that sort of freedom and agency in mobile games as well?
Respondent 4: Actually not.  Maybe it's because I'm not preferring such kinds of games.  So for example, Age of Empires, those things are mobile, and even though they promote some sort of freedom, I haven't used such games.  But maybe I will have used some [0:07:51] 2048 some game like Angry Birds.  So, very simple games just for time passing and not completely into gaming.
Respondent 4: So for example, when I used to play on my PC, I used to spend hours, say, some four hours, five hours, even more.  But mobile games are for time passing, maybe minutes, say ten minutes or twenty minutes I would play a game.  But never once did I feel like I had to progress with this game.  Somewhere I have to spend so that's why I used this game.  
Respondent 4: But in the case of the PC, I had the mentality that now I have to progress, so I'd be more preoccupied and more excited to know what's going to happen next.  So that curiosity and that element of surprise, I don't get when I play using a mobile.
Interviewer: Okay.  So do you think it's fair to say there's more immersion in that game experience in…
Respondent 4: Exactly, in a PC.
Interviewer: …in desktop PC games, then?
Respondent 4: Yeah, that's correct.
Interviewer: Okay, I see.  Okay, good.  Well, let's now have a look at the second slide for You and Games, some of the key words that came up.  So you've mentioned some of the experience and the games and the platforms, and you also mentioned you used to play something like, did you say, four hours a day, something like that when you were a gamer?
Respondent 4: Yeah, four hours, yeah.
Interviewer: And now, not so much at all?
Respondent 4: Exactly.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, I see.  What about the money aspect?
Respondent 4: Money in the sense of how much I would be willing to pay for a game?
Interviewer: Well, if you were (laughs) willing to pay.  Some people aren't.
Respondent 4: I would prefer to pay something under [0:09:35] for a game, say a game like Far Cry or something, but most preferably I would [0:09:41].  But if it is a kind of game that is more interesting, with all the graphical element which gives me more opportunity to explore the game scene and things like that, then I would be more happy to offer a hundred dollars.  However, I feel a hundred dollars is something, the max which I can afford.
Interviewer: Okay, okay.  So you're prepared to put in the investment if you think that it has the depth of experience?
Respondent 4: Exactly, yeah.
Interviewer: No, that's interesting.  There's one thing here, the game types you mentioned, also other players.  What about contact with other players?  Is that something that's in your gaming experience?
Respondent 4: Actually, I have an experience of playing with—  Yeah, so I would prefer more to be an individual perspective so only I should be in the game scene and I should face some challenges and all.  Maybe collaborative gaming is a good approach, but I haven't given it a try so I don't have a proper viewpoint about it.  But I have heard from some of my friends who are frequently involved in this collaborative gaming where they have other people to contribute in the scene, but I haven't been into that.  But yeah, if I had given a chance for that, then I would prefer it.
Interviewer: Hmm, I see.  So have you met people that have played the same PC games that you have?  Is that something that's happened?
Respondent 4: Uh-huh.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  Does that happen more offline than online?
Respondent 4: Yeah, exactly.  So I would prefer to take more offline games and, yeah, even with respect to online, I haven't played many online games.  But yeah, mostly offline games with specific tasks.  Because maybe the problem would have been, with online games, they require more of this internet connection and your speed should be more, whereas when I used to play, I hadn't got the proper connection and internet facility.  So maybe that could have been one reason that could have allowed me to expand myself in collaborative gaming.  I'm talking, like, four years ago.
Interviewer: Okay.  Okay, I see.
Respondent 4: But whereas now we have good technology, so we can get anything and we can—  So yeah, that could be one possible reason.  And then [0:12:08] when I play a single player game and it was interesting to explore, later in the game I could share my experiences with people, so that was a different fun, I would say.
Interviewer: Right.  Okay, hm-hm.  Okay, good.  Right, I think we've more or less covered all of those areas in You and Games, so I think it's a good point now to move on to the next theme.  It's a related theme, if I move on with the slide, which is Games and the Individual.  So in this case we're thinking about the way that perhaps games might influence people in different ways and the way you think they may have influenced you, or you've seen them influence other people or heard of them influencing other people.
Respondent 4: Okay.  Hm-hm, sure.  In that regard, what exactly influence me is the fantasy, which I cannot seem to get in the real world.  So for example, in games, I can use whatever weapons I want and I can explore them, but in reality, I can see movies, I can see somewhere.  So I put myself into a world of fantasy, which I don't get elsewhere, and that's what I feel influences me to go ahead with games.  What we see in a movie, we can actually go and feel for ourselves, like maybe for the time in which we are involved in a game, so that's probably one aspect.
Respondent 4: Secondly, with respect to others, when they try to share their experience, like how they play and how they went along with the game scenes, that [influences me to say 0:13:48], okay, why don't I try that game and why don't I give a play for it?  So this is how it happens, this is how it influences me.  Or even with my [0:14:00] I used to interact, when they used to share their experience about game, so yeah, that has an element of [0:14:11], I would say.
Interviewer: Right, because I guess you've heard that some people think that this very strong sense of engaging people and involving them in a fantasy world, on some people, can even have an excessive affect where they become almost too immersed in this fantasy world.
Respondent 4: Yeah (laughs) that is—
Interviewer: I guess you've heard people mention that.  Have they mentioned that to you?
Respondent 4: Yeah, exactly, because one of my colleagues is a gamer and at times he used to play, I think, Age of Empires, and he used to share his experience of the games he used to have.  So he'd say, for example, I have to organise my army, I have to organise certain things, and actually what made him go through all those things.  It's like he feels that he's actually in the scene and he's controlling all those things.  It acts as a sort of interest and then you forget what's around you and you go on with the game scene.  So yeah, this is one experience I've heard from one of my colleagues.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, because some people think that you can even become addicted to that sort of immersive experience.
Respondent 4: Exactly, and that happened with me also.  Somewhere [based together 0:15:28] I was into a game completely and I [0:15:31] to complete a game.  So I was too much into it and as they said earlier, it was more immersive for me and I was like okay, what's going to be the end, what's going to be the climax, how is it going to be?  So [0:15:43] taking me, so a lot of questions that were – it’s around me sort of.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, right.  Do you think you've ever had the feeling of being so strongly engaged in games over a period that this has helped you to develop in some way as a person?
Respondent 4: Actually, in a person, I don't see.  Maybe the action games which I play would have improved my responsive skills, but something like, making more better responsive time.  So that could have improved, but apart from that, I don't think I have improved some skills out of it.  Maybe just because the game…
Respondent 4: (Connection break from 0:16:32 to 0:16:37)
Interviewer: Sorry, [anonymised].  Sorry.
Respondent 4: …maybe I could have improved something.
Interviewer: Sorry, [anonymised], we had a long dropout there.  Sorry.  Can I just get you to repeat what you said in the last bit?  The line dropped out.
Respondent 4: Actually, I was saying it's because of the [0:16:58].  For example, for me, I like action dramas, so maybe because of that I haven't explored it much.  So if I could have, I would have preferred some other…
Respondent 4: (Connection break from 0:17:06 to 0:17:19)
Respondent 4: So for me it's like [0:17:23].  So it's kind of the [0:17:25] I might have got, but not personally developed some skills.
Interviewer: Okay.  We talked about people playing games for a long time.  What about things like physical activity in games?
Respondent 4: Physical?  Yeah, because if you are more of a PC game and then you’ll not have a kind of physical activity, I would say, but I feel I'd have given some sort of [0:17:56] or something where you can play a bit.  Kinect, for example.  Kinect or something.
Interviewer: Kinect.  Yeah, Kinect.  Yeah, hm-hm.
Respondent 4: Yeah, Kinect and you interface a boxing game, then at least you can almost have a practise, so then that puts more…immersive.  So yeah, in PC games, I feel you don't have physical activity.  So where you are sitting down in a place for hours and you're more focusing towards the screen, you don't have the opportunity to have a physical activity.
Interviewer: Sure.
Respondent 4: But where it's in other forms of game medium, such as Kinect or [0:18:30], for example, the tennis…
Interviewer: Yeah, with the things, yeah.
Respondent 4: …those things would promote physical activity.  Whereas a PC game or a mobile game, I feel they don't promote physical activity and you tend to be seated and be much focused on the screen.
Interviewer: Right, okay.  Well let's now move on and see the next slide which has got those key words associated to games in the individual.  So we've talked about immersion and engagement and how you become very… and the possibilities of addiction.  You also mentioned some cognitive apps response times and things [0:19:08] development.
Respondent 4: Correct.  Yeah, that is correct, hm-hm.
Interviewer: I don't know if you're problem solving.  Is that something that you've felt has developed through game play at all?
Respondent 4: Actually, there was a game we played [0:19:21] which I used to play on my iPad.  It's sort of a puzzle.  For example, there'll be some things that’ll be hidden in a room, so you'll have to go and search for those things.  You have to explore the room in order to find—  So it finally connects so you take one you resolve two, you take two you resolve three because it's a sort of incremental process.
Interviewer: Incremental, hm-hm.
Respondent 4: So I was more addicted to towards it and, yeah…
Respondent 4: (Connection break from 0:19:46 to 0:19:52)
Respondent 4: I was not more into it, but I cannot deny the fact that I was too addicted towards it.  That is also true because [0:20:00] I was playing it for some days, and then later I had to leave it.
Interviewer: Okay.  We're still getting a few problems with dropouts.  I was going to suggest you turn off your video.  I'll have to leave mine on for the slides.
Respondent 4: Okay.
Interviewer: Perhaps if you turn off your video, we might avoid some of those dropouts.  Let's check.
Respondent 4: Okay, I'll just go for it.
Interviewer: Just go onto audio and we'll see if that improves.
Respondent 4: Yeah.  Is it okay?
Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
Respondent 4: Okay.
Interviewer: Sorry I can't see you, but (laughs) I can hear you loud and clear, which is the important thing.  Okay, we were mentioning physical activity.
Respondent 4: Okay.  I suppose you only need the voice, right?
Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, we just need the audio, so that's okay.  We didn't mention… well, collaboration, you said you don't normally play collaborative games and things online.
Respondent 4: Yeah.
Interviewer: What about competition?
Respondent 4: Ah, so yeah, competitive games I have played.  For example, there was a game which involved archery.  So, there, you have to compete with more players.  So that one I played for maybe a week or so.  That's again a mobile game and not a PC game.  So that was more addictive and you compete with more people from various places.  So that was fun.  That was definitely fun and, yeah, I enjoyed it for a while.  But later, I was unable to sustain myself in that.
Interviewer: Sure, okay.  Okay, I think we've covered that theme pretty well now, so we can perhaps move on to the next one, which is, in a certain sense, your area of professional activity.  So that's the application of games applied to things other than entertainment.  Perhaps if we can stick with you as a player in this case, with your player hat on rather than as your researcher hat.
Respondent 4: Okay (laughs).
Interviewer: What is your feeling or your experience of games applied to things other than entertainment?
Respondent 4: For example, I see that as a good improvement in a way because, actually, games go more within entertainment.  So it's like when we play games, entertainment goes actually more, so they don't go for other sectors.  But when we try to exploit them to others, because it's a different approach in the first place, I see there's a different approach.  Definitely games have an ability to immerse people, so, compared to other mediums, they can actually talk with the player and they can bring the player into the context.
Respondent 4: So what I feel when we try to take them to other domains, we have more privilege and we have more opportunity to convey information to players through games, just because they have the ability to immerse people.  So we can just try to convey that it can be used for entertainment and information sharing, for example, learning languages or trying to build new skills.  So we can use games in such aspects and I see that's a sort of implement, and also, yeah, it's a good tool if you use it in this aspect rather than entertainment.
Respondent 4: However, we cannot deny the fact of entertainment.  That's what makes it more immersive, so it goes hand in hand.  We just cannot detach it completely.  So, yeah.
Interviewer: Sure.  Hm-hm, I see.  What about gamification?
Respondent 4: Gamification?
Interviewer: Hm-hm.
Respondent 4: I would say how exactly [0:23:44] strategy.  So, gamification sits well with strategy.  So, how we include points and how we make players progress with that, it goes more with the strategy.  So it's like I feel your strategy should be strong in order for gamification to be more powerful.
Interviewer: Right.  And have you had experience in a sort of gamification environment in some respect, as a player I mean, outside of—?
Respondent 4: As a player, I have played some games for exploring some environment where you try to collect some news with which you move from one room to another room and you try to search for things where you find some news and all, but this was part of some experiment I tried.  
Respondent 4: Yeah, directly I have an experience, but there was one application, which is called Duolingo, where I felt gamification was there.  It was this language application where it promotes people to learn languages.  So there, I felt where you see a graph that builds upon, which adds the points for the correct answers.  Yeah, I felt that was a good strategy, and yeah, I see it as a game and it had good gamification elements, and that's why it became more popular, I think.
Interviewer: Right.  So you think language learning is one of those areas that the gamification could be effective for?
Respondent 4: Could be of interest, yeah.
Interviewer: Right, okay.  Okay, let's—
Respondent 4: And also—
Interviewer: Yeah, go on.
Respondent 4: Yeah, sorry.  And also, for example, if you're trying to give some safety training or some sort of training or knowledge that you want to introduce to people, you can do it through gamification.  We can add some elements so they can form a solid and robust base with which players can understand and [cope 0:25:32] with the instructions rather than just giving them a printed sheet of the instructions.  It has two forms, so, ideally, the gamification will [be] more effective.
Interviewer: So you see the effectiveness as being like in the sense of the activity of being engaged in an activity?
Respondent 4: Yeah, exactly.  You experience that activity and you try to get something out of it, and that's when you learn.  So I feel it's more effective learning.
Interviewer: Okay, good.  Okay, well let's have a look now at those key words related to applications of games that have come up in the project.  You've talked about serious games of learning and gamification.  [They're other school 0:26:20] as part of learning as well.  Did you ever have any experience of game-based learning at school?
Respondent 4: No, I haven't experienced such games in school, but I wish (laughs).
Interviewer: Right (laughs).  What about sport and rehabilitation, things like that?
Respondent 4: Yes, sports I have been into.  So, sports like basketball and sometimes cricket.  So I have been into some sports and have tried some outdoor games, and also some indoor games we used to play, like chess, backgammon.
Interviewer: Uh-huh.  Any digital ones in that sense, digital sports?
Respondent 4: Digital sports, as in in my school?
Interviewer: Hm-hm.
Respondent 4: No, I haven't tried in my school.
Interviewer: Okay.  Also earning with games is mentioned here.  Have you had any experience of that?
Respondent 4: No, earning with games I haven't been into.  Maybe as an aspect of play.  You're asking as in an aspect of playing?
Interviewer: Sometimes you get professional competitive players in these sports and things.
Respondent 4: Ah, okay.  No, I haven't experienced earning with games.
Interviewer: Okay.  Right, okay.  Good.  So that, I think, has probably covered quite well this particular theme, so we can now move on to the next one, which is to do with ethical issues.  In your experience, have you had any experiences or occasions when you think ethical questions have arisen in games or game playing?
Respondent 4: Mostly when we played these action games we used to get a prompt, like how this is meant—  It's related to age also, I feel, so you need to be over eighteen in order to progress with these games.  But perhaps I haven't faced some ethical issues with them, only this.  I would feel like most of the games, especially as my genre of games is action, this is the only thing I would face.  But yeah, apart from that—
Interviewer: Right, I understand.  So on those age restrictions, why do you think those age restrictions were applied to those particular—?
Respondent 4: It's because of the brutality involved in the game.  So for example, you have to accomplish something, you have to kill some targets and things like that.  So because the game strategy is like that, maybe just because of that, people should be over-eighteen in order to progress with that, not to induce violence in kids.  It's another aspect because people, as they get more immersed in such kinds of action games, sometimes when it goes for kids and they try to experiment it at the end of the day.
Interviewer: Okay (laughs), yes, it could be risky.
Respondent 4: That should not happen.  Again, there's another point that just hit me related to ethical issues.  For example, games like Pokémon and other things, they use a location, so I feel we should have a second thought with games that require your personal data, such as location, camera and your [0:29:47] mobile, access to your personal folder.  So I feel a game shouldn't have these things.  They shouldn't collect any individual data.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, I see.
Respondent 4: At least when it goes for the collaborative medium.  So, when multiplaying, your personal data should not be exploited.  So I feel, yeah, it should not be.
Interviewer: Right.  What about another aspect that's often talked about with games, the way people are represented in games, or different sorts of people are represented in games?  Has that ever been a question you've considered?
Respondent 4: No, actually.  For me, it was okay, it was absolutely okay, because as I said, the whole point of gaming for me is a matter of fantasy.  So I see everything as a fantasy.  So I didn't have a major concern of the characters or some people who are into their games or some different types of people are into games.  So I haven't noticed it, maybe because I see it more from a fantasy view.
Interviewer: Right, okay.  Good.  Okay, so let's have a look on the next slide, some of the key words that have come up related to ethical issues.
Respondent 4: Okay, hm-hm.
Interviewer: So we've mentioned things like violence and aggression and so on…
Respondent 4: Exactly, hm-hm.
Interviewer: …and what we were saying about identity and diversity.  So for you, if I understood rightly, you don't see it as a concern, things like representing different races or different genders, the way they are represented in a game as part of a fantasy world, yeah?
Respondent 4: Yeah, that's true.
Interviewer: Okay.  What about the monetisation of games?
Respondent 4: That can be done, but as I said, when a game is monetised it should have a value for that.  So—  Hello?
Interviewer: We had a dropout.  Can you say that again for a second?
Respondent 4: Hello?
Interviewer: [anonymised], can you hear me?
Respondent 4: Yeah.  Actually, I was telling that when an aspect of monetisation is involved, the game needs to have a value in order to be monetised.  So that value can be—  It's not only [0:32:14] but also it should create curiosity in people, it should create the curiosity.  So when you have that, then yeah, it can be monetised.  
Respondent 4: But the thing I noticed about the mobile games is, whenever you are playing, all of a sudden your play gets interrupted and there pops an ad.  So that sort of disrupts my play completely and, instead, it creates an irritation.  So when you are into something deeply and all of a sudden it's getting intruded, that's not okay.  So this is getting monetised by developers, so I feel, yeah, that should not be done.  Maybe they should find some other medium to monetise their games, but not to disrupt the player and create sort of a negative experience.  Yeah, that's my concern.
Interviewer: Okay.  What about piracy?  We've mentioned the economics side of games.  How do you see that?  Although, you mentioned that you are prepared to pay a reasonable amount for a good quality game, but of course, some people aren't prepared or aren't able to, and so piracy is a problem.
Respondent 4: Exactly.  What happens is, they try to gain money through this.  So what happens is one, [he has to pay for a game 0:33:44], one hundred dollars, and he can raise a copy online with which people can get for less than five dollars.  So if he's going to do that, then that gets spread and he earns more than a hundred dollars.
Respondent 4: So yeah, piracy is big time evil and, yeah, the maker should find a way to somehow stop it, like somehow taking access off your internet or something to understand whether you are running a pirated version or not.  Yeah, I wouldn't support piracy in that regard.  So if you need an experience, then you'll have to go and pay for it.
Interviewer: Okay.  And one last key word there is inclusion.
Respondent 4: Okay.  So, in what regard?
Interviewer: That's the inclusiveness of games.  So that's either all people are able to engage in a game experience, irrespective of their skills…
Respondent 4: Age and—
Interviewer: …and your identity, or whatever.  Do you see that as an issue at any point?
Respondent 4: Yeah, actually, that's a big research question, inclusion, I feel, because what happens is, a single game that cannot compensate all users because each and every individual they have their own perspectives.  They have their own skill sets and they have their own abilities and, for example, and they have their genre, which is the most important point I wanted to highlight because, yeah, not all people have the same face.  It's really hard to create a game that would suffice for all people.  So yeah, I haven't seen such a kind of game, [0:35:34] game.
Respondent 4: I would say, okay, this inclusion is accessible when I play the same game as played by my dad [0:35:43].
Interviewer: Sorry, can you say that again?  Are you there?
Respondent 4: Okay, okay.  Now it's fine.
Interviewer: Now it's better?  Okay.
Respondent 4: Yeah.  Actually, we were talking about inclusion and I was telling the fact that inclusion will be successful when I play a game and I'm happy about it and my dad plays the same game and he also gets the same experience as I am.  And the same goes for my family.  So if everyone could play that game, that's when the aspect of inclusion is successful, I feel.  But still, that's a bit difficult, I feel (laughs).
Interviewer: It is (laughs), to be able to provide a game experience that's equally engaging for a whole wide—
Respondent 4: Yeah, satisfies all—
Interviewer: Okay, good.  Okay, so I think we can move on to the next theme now, which is games in society.  So, so far we've been talking mainly in terms of individuals and yourself and your own experience and your own view.  So now we're thinking more in terms of perhaps the influence that games may have on society in general.  Do you see games having any sort of particular influence at a society level?
Respondent 4: Actually, I have seen some games that were having an impact on a part of society, say for example, college students or some youth or some people.  So I have seen such games that were making an impact on them.  For example, when [0:38:15] was launched, people were crazy about it, at least in my circle.  [0:38:19] I was the only person who hadn't tried it, but everyone was speaking about it and everyone was getting more into it.  So okay, that gave me a sort of curiosity of, okay, what is it that game has got?  Let me go and give it a try.  And that's how I came to that game.
Respondent 4: So that's one element, and yeah, apart from that, I haven't seen some games that has influenced [0:38:44] in society.  Maybe in my locality it's like that, so—
Interviewer: So you see like a particular game that perhaps could become a sort of medium that different people engage with and somehow it gathers people together in an experience?  Is that the sort of influence you see to help socialisation?
Respondent 4: Yeah, exactly.  So that's what I saw in that game, which I wanted to tell you about.  And there was another game, which is called 2048.  You have to solve the puzzle and you have to get the points of 2048, and that became famous among students and everybody was trying out that game, and it really went viral all of a sudden.  So maybe in a week or so it got a good boom and it was the talk of the town, actually.  And then later I also tried it and, yeah, people used to discuss how they [built 0:39:44] strategies to follow and maybe I personally would've got some three to four inputs, as in four strategies to resolve that game.  
Respondent 4: So likewise, I feel, yeah, obviously they do have an impact, but in my aspect, if you ask as a whole of society, I see some parts of society gets influenced, but maybe not as a whole.
Interviewer: Right.  It's very interesting what you're saying about somehow games supporting socialisation, because I'm sure you've come across different opinions or impressions people have about computer games isolating people.
Respondent 4: Yeah.
Interviewer: So that's quite different from the sorts of impacts that you see.
Respondent 4: Yeah, that's true in a way.
Interviewer: Have you had any experience or seen or heard of people talking about an isolating influence that games may have on people, the opposite?
Respondent 4: As in isolating them from their day-to-day activities, you mean to say?
Interviewer: Hmm.
Respondent 4: Not such, because I haven't got that view, but instead, I used to [0:40:58].  I'm more interested towards the game that I am playing, so I don't think about what's happening around me.  So I used to get [0:41:05] aspect, so they feel themselves more immersed.  So they don't see themselves as isolated, but instead, they see themselves as immersed.  So if they ask, okay, how do you play  - oh like I’m immersed they don't say I'm isolated.  
Respondent 4: So I got these kinds of experiences, and even I, myself, when I am completely into it, I wouldn't see myself as isolated.  Obviously if you take it as reality and I’m actually isolated from my activities, I'm completely watching a screen and I'm into it, focusing thoroughly, then, yeah, it's isolation.  But I wouldn't tell, okay, I'm isolated.  Instead, I'm enjoying the game, I would say.
Interviewer: Okay.  So it's your state of mind that's important?
Respondent 4: Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, that plays [0:41:54].
Interviewer: No, that's very interesting.  Let's have a look at some—
Respondent 4: But if you—
Interviewer: Go on.  Yeah?
Respondent 4: But if you're going to consider—  This is from a gamer's perspective.  But if you're going to consider the perspective of their friends and relatives, they might consider it, okay, he's a bit isolated from the world because he's completely gaming.  So yeah, it's a state of mind at the end of the day.
Interviewer: So you think that it's something that fellow gamers or fellow players can appreciate and empathise with, but perhaps those without that experience might feel that there's a degree of social isolation through games?
Respondent 4: Actually, I think this can be understood well only by a gamer.  Say, for example, if I'm a gamer, if I go and share my experience with a gamer, then only he will understand my experience.  So he can even say, okay, that's a good aspect, you played for five hours, which is great even I do play for six hours.  So they try to share experiences, whereas if I go and have a conversation with a non-gamer, then he would consider me like, okay, he's a bit isolated.  He's not into it and he thinks that I'm talking about something which is irrelevant to him.
Respondent 4: So yeah, when you have a community of gamers, you should have equal [tasters 0:43:10] your differences and your likings, so that's when it works, I feel.  So that's when the socialisation will build.  So it's sort of a community.  The community of gamers collaborate, they interact with each other to share their experience, so that's when it expands, but not with someone who doesn't have experience with games.
Interviewer: Right, that's really interesting.  So this, I suppose, sort of gap that you see that can happen between people who play games and non-players…
Respondent 4: Non-players, yeah, exactly, is the point.
Interviewer: …is that something specific to digital games, do you think, or does that happen in other circumstances with other pursuits, like, say, television or film or literature, or other forms of culture?
Respondent 4: Usually I find it in games more because gamers have their own ideologies.  So yeah, I actually find it in games because when you consider other forms of entertainment, like movies or dramas, usually people will watch it and then they [0:44:15] their reviews up.  So you can even share about a movie, like, okay, I have seen this movie, it was good, or it was bad.  So I can share my review to a person who has seen that movie or who hasn't seen that movie and he'd be more interested to listen to my review, at least, even if he doesn't watch movies.  But whereas in the case of games, it will only interest a person who actually plays those games.  So that's what I mean to say, like it doesn't make an impact on a non-gamer.
"Respondent 4: So if I try to share my gaming experience with non-gamers, that's not going to [sound right 0:44:45] for him.  It's just another statement for him, and that's it; okay, he's just sharing some kind of statement.  But if I'm going to share with a gamer, it's not only that I'm giving him inputs but, in return, I will also get inputs from the gamer.  So he or she they [put forward a solution 0:45:04], like, okay, you can try like this, you can try these alternatives, you can experiment with this, so I find more opportunity for me to expand my gaming experience."
Interviewer: Right.  And just thinking about that experience you were talking about, a lot about perhaps the fantasy aspect, the narrative aspect and so forth, and how engaging that is for you, what about if we look at the key words here for games in society on the slide.  There's art in games.  Is art something that you would associate with digital games?
Respondent 4: Yeah, I do associate it because, in reality, games should be artistic.  When we speak about the word 'fantasy', it needs to be artistic, it needs to have that creativity.  So art does have creativity, so I think art, yeah, plays a major role in bringing forth a better game.
Interviewer: Okay.  So it seems, if I understand you, you see this as being intertwined, interconnected between the fantasy and creativity…
Respondent 4: Exactly, yeah.  So—
Interviewer: …and art are all—
Respondent 4: Yeah, that's true.  So I see it in that aspect because when we create a world.  So for example, in games, you [need to put forward the game, so you need to put forward that world 0:46:21].  So in order to do that, you need to have a strong thought process.
Interviewer: Sure.
Respondent 4: And later, then that comes out as art.  So whatever thought processes there have been, that's when you get players immersed into games.  So I feel art is a lot more interconnected.
Interviewer: Okay.  What about innovation in games?  How do you see that?
Respondent 4: Yeah, innovation is also another aspect that pulls people because if you asked me 'what is another aspect you would say meant you liked games or you enjoyed playing games', I say that's innovation because there is some sort of innovation in games.  Say for example, in Call of Duty there was an episode where [0:47:07] should be happening in 2040 AC, and they'll bring all the future technology there.  So in the game, you can see all the future technology, and that can come [in even innovative minds are 0:47:16] into development.  So I feel, yeah, that aspect of innovation is also connected and its deeply [oriented 0:47:24].   More than art, I would see innovation is the key.
Interviewer: Okay.  So you feel it's like a very firm core theme of digital games, this element of innovation?
Respondent 4: Innovation, exactly.
Interviewer: Right.  And do you feel that – you mentioned there in Call of Duty and so forth – there are other areas where you think you've experienced something that you would call innovative in terms of digital games?
Respondent 4: In that regard, for example, maybe the first game that I played, like Far Cry, where I encountered [0:48:13] which I was telling you where I can go and I can do anything in [0:48:17].  So for example, the gaming was like you have to travel to a forest and you have to migrate between islands, so there you tend to encounter wildlife and so you'll have to fight with tigers and all.  So I felt it was innovative as an aspect of the game because games mean, okay, it's not that you take a mission and you just go for it and you go ahead with all those things, but there should be some other subordinate things also associated with the main mission.  So that's where innovation also comes into play.  You need to be highly innovative in order to bring all those routes together.
Interviewer: Okay, I see.  Good.  Okay, what about marketing?  Have you ever had experience of marketing of games?
Respondent 4: Which I could see in social media now in Facebook and sometimes I used to see trailers on YouTube for games.  Yeah, the strategy of marketing has improvised and you can see it everywhere, even in Facebook, just because the browsers are reading our perspectives.  So if you're just going to go and search for a game on your browser, immediately you'll be getting suggestions on Facebook and YouTube related to such games.  So yeah, I feel that ability of marketing [0:49:35].
Interviewer: Have you gained any sort of impression of how these games are marketed or what sort of image is promoted in this form of marketing, online marketing?
Respondent 4: Actually, I see it as one of the powerful tools nowadays because I was sharing my experience, like, four years ago when I used to play games.  So at that time, I never used to see an advertisement related to games anywhere.  So if I need to get to know about a game, then I have to interact with my friends, or people who have experienced those games.  So it's word-of-mouth.  So it just happens with word-of-mouth and not with some online advertisements or something.  So that's what I see as an improvisation.  
"Respondent 4: Nowadays, the strategy for marketing is quite high and I can see most things.  It's not about the game playing; also I can check reviews, how people are seeing those things, and I can also see 'what to dos'.  Like if I'm stuck somewhere in the game, I can see proper 'what to dos', real 'what to dos' from people who have played a game.  That is also a sort of marketing because they get a lot of views of their videos."
Interviewer: Sure, hm-hm.  So you see a sort of expansion of the different outlets talking about games that could be used for marketing purposes, and are used?
Respondent 4: Yeah, that's correct.
Interviewer: Hmm, I see.  Okay, good.  Okay, so that more or less covers those main themes that we've outlined in the project so far.  Just in a way of concluding the interview, [anonymised], we'd like to give you the opportunity – and I'll just move on to the next slide, which is suggestions.  So you as a player, with your player hat on, if you like, if you had the opportunity to make suggestions in order to take games forward, say you could make suggestions to other players or game developers or to policymakers, or even to other players, to families or whatever, are there any suggestions that you would make, do you think, that could take games forward?
Respondent 4: Okay, so first I'll start with a suggestion for developers.  In the first place, they should read the minds of players.  So they should conduct some sort of—  Before, for example, if there's a series of games, one, two or three, then before they leap from three to four, they should have a sort of feedback from players.  So, based on those feedbacks, they should put forward the next version, or the next series that they are trying to do.
Respondent 4: There needs to be a lot of study about future technology, which is not possible now at the moment, presently which is not possible.  So they should bring forward all those fantasy elements into the picture.
Interviewer: Okay.  So you'd say there should be more technological development?
Respondent 4: Yeah, exactly, that's one aspect.  Also, apart from technology, it is also about the thought process.  There, you bring some ideas and you put forward all those things.  So there, I mean to say, you need to consider all those aspects.  He's coming to play a game, which means he doesn't want to see what is existing, so you should give an experience to the player in such a way that he will experience something new that is out of this world.
Interviewer: Okay.
Respondent 4: So yeah, this is how it needs to be, I feel.  And for distributors, I think, yeah, the price of games can be reduced in order to reduce piracy.  Instead, they can pull down the prices to a greater extent.  If a game is affordable for a person with its full features, or some promotions or something, then they can actually discard the aspect of piracy.  Some sort of promotions or discount coupons or something that they can distribute along with the game so that it even promotes the players to go forward and spend a couple of bucks to purchase the game, I feel.
Interviewer: So, different sort of monetisation strategies?
Respondent 4: Yeah, and maybe some more new devices they can include, apart from whatever is existing.  So it's not about just a PC because the game has travelled a whole new level now to PlayStations.  So they have advanced to a whole new level and now they will have to do R&D to bring forward new devices, which would actually make the player go into [0:54:18] completely.  So, some R&D and things like that are there, but still I feel it's an active research area where they will have to explore the opportunities of new gadgets, technologies that can be put forward to enhance the player experience.
Interviewer: Okay, good.  Okay, so these are—  I'm just putting up the final slide there with some of the key words for suggestions which, as you can see, are different.  Stakeholder groups in the game world, if you like, and you've mentioned the developers there, and researchers as well, obviously, that would be involved in that sort of technological development you mentioned.  What about educators?
Respondent 4: Educators?
Interviewer: Hmm.
Respondent 4: So, actually, I feel in order to forward games in education, they need to have a proper [0:55:14].  I mean to say, they need to have games available for education.
Interviewer: Sure.
Respondent 4: So that, again, goes back to the developers where they should again take some more room to build more games for an education purpose.  So that's when these educators can use all these games and take it towards their students.  So yeah, I feel it again goes back to the developers.
Interviewer: And have you got any other suggestions for those other groups there?
Respondent 4: Institutions?
Interviewer: Hm-hm.
Respondent 4: Institutions, I don't have any such comments.
Interviewer: Okay.  What about parents?
Respondent 4: Yeah, parents, I would say (laughs), for example, my parents don't want me to sit for five hours and play games.
Interviewer: Sure.
Respondent 4: And even if I'm going to do that, they would expect that I should learn something out of games.  Nowadays, games have been utilised in many sectors, so they should take this as an opportunity in order to bring forward more education-based games.  So if that is the case, then parents can support their kids.  For example, if they could learn maths, some basic maths, or a concept in maths through a game, then parents should be absolutely okay with that.
Respondent 4: So it depends upon the genre of games.  So I feel parents can support more education games, I feel.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  I guess they might be, I imagine, when you were talking before about the gap between gamers and non-gamers in terms of understanding what the game is about.
Respondent 4: Yeah.
Interviewer: I guess, in a lot, not always but in a lot of cases, parents are often non-gamers, are they, and, as you mentioned, they're often concerned about what their kids are doing.
Respondent 4: Yeah, exactly, and there are a lot of aspects also they are concerned, because it's not like we are just five hours completely into a game, but they are also more conscious about their health because it's not good to be seated continuously and stare towards a screen.  What happened in my case I just increased my eye power.
Interviewer: Okay (laughs).
Respondent 4: In a matter of two months, that happened, and I could see that.  I used to get frequent headaches and things like that.
Interviewer: Oh, right.
Respondent 4: So they are also concerned on these aspects for kids.  So your health is also associated with the fact that… when you are a constant gamer.
Interviewer: Right, okay.  Good.  Okay, thank you.  Well, I think—
Respondent 4: And—
Interviewer: Go on.
Respondent 4: There's one more thing I want to put forward about non-gamers.
Interviewer: Yeah, yeah.  Sure, hm-hm.
Respondent 4: It's about their own perception.  Some people, whatever the best game is you want to put forward, they're not ready to play and they're not willing to play, and that may be their perception towards games.  They might think, okay, it's just a normal thing and I don't want to get into it.  So that mentality, like, I don't want to get into it, when people have such kinds of mentality, whatever the best game is put forward, it's hard to penetrate their minds.  So it also depends upon your individual perception towards games and—
Interviewer: What do you think might create that reluctance to enter into the game?
Respondent 4: In the first place, I feel they will not have proper resources.  For example, I could have had a good gaming PC, but my family could not afford to do that.  So maybe he would have developed a hatred towards games just because he was not having the proper resource.
Respondent 4: So yeah, resource is one aspect, and for others, it's more towards their liking.  I feel some people don't like games.  It's like, okay, no, I don't like—  Even if you try to say, okay, it's good, you can try, but no, they would say—  But there are a hundred aspects.  These things do have a societal impact when 90% of people are playing games, and that obviously impacts the other 10%, I feel.
Interviewer: Ah, right.
Respondent 4: And at least in that 10%, 5% will convert and they'll try to experience that game at least once, I feel.
Interviewer: Right, I see.
Respondent 4: When the majority of society is behind that, obviously you will try.
Interviewer: To give them the opportunity to experience that gaming experience?
Respondent 4: Yeah, that's true, hmm.
Interviewer: Good.  Okay, well, [anonymised], thank you very, very much.  I think we can conclude more or less here.

Interview 5:
Interviewer: Very well.  Okay, I will explain to you how the interview works, so, as I said, we’re interested in your experience as a gamer and on your thoughts about how games influence us.
Respondent 5: Okay.
Interviewer: And I will share some slides.  (pause)  Okay, can you see the screen?
Respondent 5: Yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.  I will use these PowerPoint slides to guide our conversation, so I will show you sometimes a few keywords.  You can use them as cues.  You’re not required to talk about all the topics I’m showing, but you can use them to, I don’t know, to guide your ideas and help you collect your thoughts.  Okay?
Respondent 5: Okay.
Interviewer: So, do you have any other questions or we can begin?
Respondent 5: Sure, what do you want to know?
Interviewer: Well, to begin with, I like to know a little bit about your relationship with games, so which games do you play, how often do you play?
"Respondent 5: Well, I play – I’d like to say I play everything, but that’s probably not true; I don’t play a lot of sports games.  I tend to favour big RPG sort of games."
Interviewer: Okay.
Respondent 5: Skyrim, Fallout, Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, you know, things of that nature or just like this massive world where I can just like get lost for the next 100 hours.
Interviewer: Okay.  So mostly RPG?
Respondent 5: They are probably my favourite.  I mean I will do a lot of strategy games.  I’ll do shooters occasionally [0:02:54], but if you sat me down in front of an internet library I’d probably pick an RPG.
Interviewer: Okay.  So do you play only single player, mostly single player?
Respondent 5: Mostly single player because I don’t generally – the time I have to play video games isn’t conducive to playing with other people.  There’s not a whole lot of my friends online at 3am on a Thursday morning, so I just tend to play by myself.
Interviewer: Okay, but that’s not your choice, I gather, it’s just a timing issue?
Respondent 5: Yeah, well, it doesn’t particularly bother me.  I started streaming about a year ago so I would have people to talk to while I played at least.
Interviewer: Okay.  How much time do you play?
Respondent 5: At the moment not a lot.  There’s an issue with the house buyer so I’m kind of stuck in a hotel room.
Interviewer: Oh, okay.
Respondent 5: Normally it’s, I don’t know, 10, 12 hours a week.
Interviewer: Okay.  And how long have you been playing – how old are you, by the way?
Respondent 5: I am 25.
Interviewer: Okay, and since when have you been playing?
Respondent 5: The earliest memory I have of a video game was Super Mario for the Nintendo Entertainment System when I was – I was like five years old or something.  It was in the basement of my cousin’s, so that, I guess.  And it was just like this is the second – the second you saw it, like, “I could get into this.  This seems like something I could enjoy.”  I mean, you know, two years later it was my sole passion.
Interviewer: Do you still play on consoles or computer?
Respondent 5: I have a PC that I try to use primarily.  I got a PlayStation 4 for Christmas from a friend of mine.  He had upgraded to the Pro, I think, so I got a whole PlayStation, so I’ve got a couple of the new generation console games, but I tend to favour PC, something onscreen.
Interviewer: Okay.  Do you also play mobile games?
Respondent 5: Very, very rarely.  Most of the mobile games I play are ports of other games, like Hearthstone and [Channel Works 0:05:37] are games where they have a desktop client and just kind of, you know, something I can play on the go.
Interviewer: Yeah, so you play them both on the PC and on mobile?
Respondent 5: Yes.
Interviewer: Okay, okay.  Last thing I wanted to ask you, but of course you are free not to answer, how much do you spend typically in games, for games?
Respondent 5: Not as much as – like I generally have a budget so the games I play I usually pick up from sale or I convince people to refer, you know, special events online for me.  I mean out of my own pocket I probably spend less than like 100 or 200 a year on video games.
Interviewer: Okay, so it’s something you pay attention to?  I mean you—?
Respondent 5: Yes.
Interviewer: You program for how much you spend.  Okay.  So, to continue with our interview, I’d like to ask you a little more of an abstract question, but how do you feel that games influence you?  Do you feel they influence you in any way?  Do you feel that in all those years playing games, you’ve changed or were changed by playing?
Respondent 5: That’s a tough question.
Interviewer: I know.
Respondent 5: If I sat down and thought about it, I would imagine it probably helped me strategically thinking, because I play a lot of card games online, you know, things like Hearthstone and I play a lot of the strategy games, Total War, Solaris, you know, things like that, so if I had to say it influenced something, it’s probably, you know, a bit of like the forward thinking effects.
Interviewer: Okay.
Respondent 5: They helped me – I’d say I probably think further ahead than I’d do if I didn’t play those games quite as well.
Interviewer: And you think this is a – do you feel this is also something you take outside of gaming?  I mean—?
Respondent 5: Yes.
Interviewer: Okay, so you feel it impacts on your daily life too, in a way?
Respondent 5: Oh yeah, yeah.  I would definitely – I would definitely say I feel that impact, that better critical thinking, I suppose, outside the game.
Interviewer: I am showing you the keywords.  If there is something else that catches your eye, or, for example, something I would like to ask of you is if you think that games can be addictive, you know, in a negative way, I mean.
"Respondent 5: I – if you look at what people have been addicted to historically, I mean it’s literally everything.  Addiction is – in a lot of cases it’s a mind-set; it’s something that you have trained your body to want.  It’s not so much a physical thing.  I mean that aspect there, I definitely believe people can get addicted to video games as a concept or as a reward system because it is a very – it’s an enjoyable experience.  It’s a very rewarding thing.  And game creators know that.  They’ve devised their games in such a way that you get regular bursts of, you know lights and sounds and enjoyable things to try and keep you hooked.  You see this a lot with RPGs where they spread the progression out just slightly enough so when you get far enough, you get a new item, you get a new level, you feel happy.  It creates a rush and it’s like a circle effect."
Interviewer: Yeah, it’s more reward, yeah.
Respondent 5: Mobile games in particular make their entire industry off of just addicting the type of people who will spend tens of thousands of dollars on the free-to-play games, you know, buying and adding to level packs or whatever, so without a doubt you could say people can get addicted to games.
Interviewer: Yeah.  Also you did say you play some free-to-play games, am I right, like Hearthstone?
Respondent 5: Yes.
Interviewer: And did you spend money on it or do you try not to or—?
Respondent 5: I have.  In the case of Hearthstone they now – I mean in addition to card packs [0:10:45] game, but they also had like – it has a DLC sort of content so I bought some of that as well.  So I think in the three or four years I’ve had Hearthstone I’ve spent $50, $60 on it of my own money.  Then, you know, people give me like cards to battle again, so I’ve probably done another $40 or so from here.
Interviewer: I would also like to ask you what you think about collaboration and competition in games.  I mean you don’t play much multiplayer games, so maybe you don’t feel this as much, but some games you play are competitive, competing with other people?
Respondent 5: Yes, it’s sort of – are you talking just like, you know, casual multiplayer or full-scale eSports events?
Interviewer: Well, that depends on whether you play, I mean.  But—
Respondent 5: I’ve played quite a bit of CS:GO on the PC so I’m familiar with multiplayer and the group of friends that I have online when they are there or when I have a day off or something, that’s one of the games I tend to play.
Interviewer: And something I didn’t quite understand, so when you play multiplayer, do you play with people you already know in person, so those people you consider your friends, or do you also play with strangers on the internet?
Respondent 5: That will depend on the game.  For something like CS:GO, my track record, which is, you know, solo cues, randomly jump into the game and get random [0:12:49], I get a lot of – a lot of – perhaps a lot of like less than friendly people, you know, very sort of more independent people, so it’s not the type of person I generally want to work with on things.  So when I play something like CS:GO or Overwatch or something, then I prefer to team with my friends.  I tend to avoid random people when there are a lot of us in games. 
Respondent 5: Yeah, other games it will just depend.  It’s something I – like in [Alma 0:13:29] Battle Royale or something, I’m fine teaming with random people.  I guess it just depends.
Interviewer: Okay.  So the next thing I would like to ask you is whether you can see some practical application or video games, so using games not only for entertainment but for some practical purpose.  I mean you already said you feel you bring your strategical thinking that you learn with the games, you take that into your daily life.  Do you think, for example, the games can be used to teach that, to improve people in this kind of skill?
Respondent 5: I believe so.  I think if handled properly, you can use video games as a very effective teaching tool if done correctly, because the whole experience I talked about earlier as far as like addition, you know, there is a grey bit there, you can use that rewarding scale to try and help teach people.  It’s an interactive medium.  It’s not like you’re sitting someone down in front of a video, watch this as this guy explains it.  You’re taking a part of the activity or team.  So that is a very powerful tool, I think.  
Respondent 5: When that’s utilised correctly you can use it to be a teaching tool.  And at least in the United States we’ve seen some basic attempts at like using video games to teach like map interactions and stuff like that.  There’s already some basic, you know, preliminary acceptance in that field for the last decade or so.  So I feel that there is plenty of room to go in that direction.  It’s very much an option if they utilise it properly.
Interviewer: But I would like to ask you a little more about what you mean by using it properly.  Do you think there is something that should be done to use them properly or some mistakes that maybe are easy to make when using games for teaching?
"Respondent 5: The biggest mistake I see is trying – you have to strike a balance between what your goal is and, you know, the players’ interaction.  And the biggest mistake is either going one way so the player just has like an open sand box and they don’t learn anything, you know.  Just give it the box of Lego and they’ll do whatever they want.  You need some sort of guided thing in order to get something out of it.  And the other big issue with those, I saw at least in my classrooms, was they were too guided.  There was very much too controlled of a path.  It wasn’t any different from me sitting down and watching a video.  Sure, I could, you know, drag the numbers and we’re going to have an answer to a math problem, but there’s only one way it would go in.  There were no extra numbers.  It was like there’s a two, there’s a two and there’s a four, can you put this math problem in order?  Well, literally anyone could if you can move a mouse, so I think that’s the biggest issue of it not being proper.  It’s either too freeform or it’s too structured; you don’t get anything out of it without, you know, a bit of leeway, a bit of critical thinking, a chance for failure, I guess."
Interviewer: And I’m asking myself, I mean do you think that this kind of guidance is something that is specifically needed for teaching through games because the games you cited as the games you are playing with, some are very open-ended, like Skyrim, and some are very constrained and guiding the player, like Final Fantasy, for example.  So do you think that entertaining can be also very – can let the player really free to explore, but when teaching we should be a little more focused?  Am I getting that right?
Respondent 5: Depends on the MO behind the concepts.  I mean for most people they don’t go, hey this is supercritical, the experience or whatever, but [0:18:27] people have different tastes and like movies, sometimes you don’t want to sit down and watch action movies you want to watch comedy or whatever, and actually that works in the games, you know, an extension of that, it just all depends on what you [0:18:45] idea, a set goal or some sort of model in order to do it effectively.
Interviewer: Okay.  And are you familiar with the term serious games and gamification?
Respondent 5: I’m aware of what?
Interviewer: Sorry, I didn’t hear you well.  I’m getting an awful lot of noise from your side.  Look, I will try to disable my video so maybe the connection will go a little better.  Can you hear me?
Respondent 5: Yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.  So I was saying, sorry, do you have familiarity with the term serious games and gamification?
Respondent 5: Vaguely, yes.
Interviewer: Okay.
Respondent 5: Mainly the concepts.
Interviewer: Okay, well I will try to define them for you as we mean it – we mean them.  So by serious games we mean games that are specifically used – created for a purpose different from entertainment.  So, for example, we want to use games for teaching, we can use a commercial game that, by the way, teaches you something, or we can create a game specifically for teaching.  This second one we will call serious games.
Interviewer: And by gamification we mean the use of game elements outside of a game also for a specific purpose.  So, for example, I’m thinking of those iPhone apps like Runtastic or apps like that that track how much you run and give you a score for that and make some kind of competition around an activity that is not a game.  Okay?
Respondent 5: Alright.
Interviewer: And I was wondering if you have any experience with these kind of apps or systems.
Respondent 5: As far as gamification sort of app, I actually used one for a couple of months actually when I was trying to lose weight, and it was very similar to how you described.  You put in what your current status was, so how much you weighed that day, how much exercise and it sort of like created like a faux level-up chart or something.  Like I’m familiar with that sort of process.  My – I mean my overall thoughts on like gamification apps is maybe they work if people have – if that’s the goal they want.  If they’re just – they really want – like for a weight loss app, the problem really is to get healthy, if that’s what they actually want then these applications could be very useful as a way to make the process not quite so clinical, make you feel like you’re getting something out if it, because when you’re losing – when you’re losing weight it’s miserable because you’re always hungry all the time and if you’re doing a lot of exercise to supplement that, your body is always sore, so trying something to help that out.
Interviewer: But in a way you’re saying you already need some motivation towards a goal.
Respondent 5: Exactly, it’s not something that – if you’re just random – it’s not [0:22:29].  I could really lose 10, 15 pounds, I don’t think like an app like that is going to help.  It helps those who are already wanting to do it, but it, by itself, isn’t and probably shouldn’t be the spur of, you know, activity.
Interviewer: Okay, I see.  I would like to move to the next topic, which is whether you can see some ethical issues in games, both in the use of games and in the messages they are conveying to players.
Respondent 5: There’s a lot, at least in the United States, there’s a history of ethical concerns of video games.  Our legal system has looked at them a couple of dozen times now because some of the themes and the messages and commercially available products, like Mortal Combat in particular almost got video games banned back in the 1990s, so it’s very much, as someone who, you know, is very well immersed into this world, it’s something I’m very familiar with.  And a lot of games, even to this day, they don’t shy away from those topics.
"Respondent 5: Something like The Last of Us on the PlayStation, you know, you will go into very morally great things, so very dark things in order to reach a certain conclusion, I don’t want to spoil the game for people who haven’t played it, but it’s tells a very gripping story but there was a lot of moral, ethical decisions that don’t always leave the player feeling comfortable after it happened.  And I think that at least in the commercial and into entertainment experience, I think that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  There are a lot of movies and music that tried to do the same thing.  Their goal isn’t to make you smile or to make you laugh or whatever; their goal is to get you to think about something.  And at least as an entertainment thing or as a thought-provoking thing, that isn’t a horrible idea, but if your goal is to try and, you know, make video games into a service or try to use it to reach some sort of conclusion, that might be the wrong way to go about it."
Respondent 5: So I don’t know.  It’s a very complicated topic and it’s really hard to – it’s really hard to go into detail with what would be the right thing for the entire concept of it all.
Interviewer: But what kind of problems do you think could arise, I mean?
Respondent 5: The biggest problem, at least in the United States, is the lack of real oversight, I suppose.  I mean the games have a rating board.  You know, they’re rated E for everyone, you know, PG, M for mature, whatever, adult only.  The thing is this is – it was a self-regulated market so there’s no legal recourse to enforce it.  
Respondent 5: So for a game like The Last of Us or for, you know, Call of Duty, where you’re murdering people every two seconds, those – there’s nothing to stop those titles from getting in the hands of, you know, younger people, you know, adults or teenagers, for random things.  That’s, at the moment, the most prevalent concern, at least in the US.  For something like The Last of Us that I mentioned, I would not want a kid to go anywhere near the game, a kid [0:26:34] because it does deal with very particular things and it’s how do you regulate it or how do you address those sorts of concerns.
Interviewer: So you feel there is not enough regulation right now?  Can you hear me?  [anonymised]?  I can’t hear you any more.  Okay, I hear you now.
Respondent 5: Again, hotel WiFi.
Interviewer: Don’t worry.  But I was saying that you believe there is not enough regulation on selling games.
Respondent 5: I don’t know if it’s necessarily a regulation concern or more a consumer, parent education concern.  It’s – I don’t know what the proper approach is.  I’m not a politician, trying to – instead of me trying to explain the Mona Lisa, it’s a painting that exists but I couldn’t go anything into the history.  I don’t know if I feel like I’m qualified to say what the right answer is to that question. 
Interviewer: Of course, but, you know, we’re interested in your view of the situation, so—
"Respondent 5: If I had to take a stab in the dark, I don’t think as far as like ethical concerns with video games, I think they’re at an appropriate point as far as what the industry is doing as a whole, I don’t think it’s a massive concern.  But I think the biggest issue isn’t necessarily regulation; it’s more end user education, you know, trying to tell or explain to parents and older generations, you know, within this medium what’s appropriate and what’s not.  You know, it’s very easy to sit down in front of a movie where the first thing that flashes is that this is not rated for younger audiences, you know.  That’s something very easy to explain versus, you know, in a lot of movies they’ll say, you know, because of violence, because of language or sexual content.  A lot of video games don’t do that from the outset.  There’s a sticker on the back of the box or a tiny little letter that tells me what it’s rated, but it doesn’t give the context as to why it has that rating."
Respondent 5: You know, some people feel that language is okay versus other people who feel, you know, sexual content is the devil and it shouldn’t be anywhere near my children, it’s just something that needs – I think it just needs more thought but not necessarily more regulation.
Interviewer: More detail, you would say?
Respondent 5: Yeah.
Interviewer: Okay, okay.  Another issue I would like to touch upon is monetisation of games, because you already told me about free-to-play games and also you know other ways of earning money by not properly selling video games but, for example, selling subscription to a video game or selling DLCs.  What do you think about those kind of arrangements?
Respondent 5: There’s a couple of ways that video games will make money outside of the sticker price that you were mentioning.  And it depends on the specific sort of thing that – DLC is a concept, if it’s executed properly, is fine.  You know, after the game is finished the developers and the art team and programmers, they all want to make more of this game so there’s no problem with them – I have no problem with them making more of the game and then selling it two months later.
"Respondent 5: For free-to-play games, it’s a bit of a shirkier topic, because a lot of them will break down into one of two ways, one where it becomes like a fashion game, essentially just buying a whole bunch of cosmetics so your character looks the best on the battlefield, you know.  You’re going out there with a straw hat and a rainbow rifle or whatever.  You know, that’s fine with me; it doesn’t affect other people’s experience if you look like a clown out there, but I feel it’s an appropriate way to do it.  And the art team in particular always thinks there’s game development very early but are one of the first teams to finish, so them working on sales before the rest of the team finishes isn’t a huge concern with me."
Respondent 5: My biggest issue with concepts like that is where it – you’ll see it a lot more in free-to-play models in particular, where parts of the game get made overly hard or particularly grindy.  Korean MMO in particular are infamous for this where the grind is ridiculous.  It takes several hours to gain a level in one skill, much less the other 50 that you have to worry about.  Or, instead of that, just for the small price, you know, 5.99 or whatever, you can get your next level right away and you face a situation where you’re – in the American industry it’s fishing for royalties.  You’re looking for a small percentage of people to spend as much money as possible on the games.  You have less than 1% of your players spending thousands of dollars so they have the strongest character on the server.  
Respondent 5: And you have the game [0:32:51].  The game is made slower.  Specific items can be cut out.  So like imagine Skyrim without the dragon beams.  You instantly make the final fight ludicrously hard because you don’t have extra damage on that type of creature, and that would just be in some games, some publishers, that stuff gets cut out to resell for you.  You know, the game is still technically complete, you know, just like a car will still technically run, but, you know, if you want fuel for the car, that’s an extra.
Respondent 5: It’s just a very – it’s a very tricky line I find with the cosmetics.  There’s a lot of these other models in theory.  I don’t mind cosmetics.  I don’t mind subscription models.  I’ve played them and always paid for their service because I enjoyed it, but there is a very risky slope to where the game is made less enjoyable to appeal to money or parts of the games are taken out because they know people need that part of the game in order to progress.  That’s my problem with it.  In theory it’s acceptable, but you have to be wary of [34:06].
Interviewer: Another thing I wanted to ask, especially because you play a lot of RPGs, which are very character-driven games, is how do you see the portrayal, for example of gender or race, if you think that it’s inadequate or it’s adequate or do you see any trends?  I don’t know.
Respondent 5: Speaking very broadly as the industry as a whole, it is – it’s horribly sexist.  When you have a female character and a male character and there’s just one item in the game that just says two different skins, a lot of times, you know, like a steel armour will fully cover the male.  The female character it’s just, you know, a fancy bra with some sparkles on.
Interviewer: The chainmail bikini, yeah.
"Respondent 5: Exactly.  And that is an actual legitimate thing.  I have seen it myself.  That’s not some sort of exaggeration from the media; that exists in a lot of RPGs.  And if you ever pop along to – if you do game server as a woman or as the only woman on the server, it is particularly horrible, I guess, without getting into too many [0:35:38], it’s a very – it can be a very hostile environment and a lot of – to get into a lot of these sorts of games as a woman, you have to either be quiet and just not talk or you have to have thick skin enough so you can climb – you can wade through all the drudgery and find good people, people who don’t care about gender."
Respondent 5: As far as industry as a whole, it definitely has a lot to go in order for them to be much more of an equal sense, but for individual games, there’s a lot of games that do it perfectly.
Interviewer: For example?
Respondent 5: On the PlayStation 4 recently was amazing, and I didn’t have any of those particular trappings as far as like armour or, you know, discussion group, anything like that, and the fact that the lead character is female is only really brought up once and it gets shot down like two minutes later.  It’s really well done if you’ve not played that game, the idea.  So the industry, for female – for women, if you’re aiming for gender equality, it has a bit of ways to go but it’s getting there.
Interviewer: So you think it’s making progress?
Respondent 5: Yes.
Interviewer: Okay.  Do you think the same goes for portrayal of different races too?
Respondent 5: Race is really hard to judge.  I mean if you look at like lead characters in video games, yes, it seems progress is a lot less, you know, white male European guys, you know, Egyptian assassin brotherhood, whatever.  There is a lot less of that than there used to be and the localisation and things of that nature has done a much better job to try not to whitewash a product or whatever.  It’s another one I think that they could probably do a bit better, but it’s not as big a gap to go as it is with just women in general.  Like, you know, lead characters of colour have been a thing for quite a while.  I mean even recently at E3, the new Assassin’s Creed game from Ubisoft, you know, black lead character and all that so a lot of games have female characters in one of the leads and the new Wolfenstein is a black woman, so much less something like Mafia 3, like last year where half the lead was black.  
Respondent 5: So at least for that sense they’ve got a ways to go, just, I don’t know, it still has progress because a lot of games still break down to, you know, the US shooting down brown people in some other country, so – and at least as far as that goes if we’re not shooting at a Nazi or, you know, a terrorist, you still have some ways to go as far as that one goes, retraining what people think are enemies.
Interviewer: Yeah, okay.  But you still think it’s less of a problem that – than female characterisation?
Respondent 5: Right, it’s still a problem but like women, it’s made progress and I think it’s made more progress than the female characters.
Interviewer: Okay.  Moving on to the next topic, which is maybe the more abstract question in the interview, but I would like to ask you how do you feel or how do you see that game influence society in general?
Respondent 5: I believe gaming, at least in the United States, it’s mainstream.  It’s part of pop culture at this point, you know.  E3 was this week and there was something like a million people on Twitch watching it.  It got better ratings than half of cable television.  You can’t argue with those sorts of numbers, you know, people making references to things at the time, publishers throwing millions and millions out as far as advertising goes for trying to get the word out there.  I don’t know if you watch wrestling at all, but…
Interviewer: No.
Respondent 5: …WWE, there’s a company, the biggest wrestling company in the world and their biggest event this year, WrestleMania, was sponsored by Final Fantasy.
Interviewer: Okay.  I didn’t know that.
"Respondent 5: Yeah, like it’s ridiculous.  They had the hosts come out and address this Final Fantasy character, you know, with Chocobos and a Moogle on his shoulder, so it’s – you can’t deny that it’s there.  The average – in the United States the average gamer is a 28-year-old male.  It’s not some sort of, you know, children’s hobby any more; it is very much a mainstream thing.  GTA 5 launch week was the biggest launch week in all of entertainment, period.  No other product, movie, music, TV show sold more in their first week than Grand Theft Auto 5 did.  It’s just ridiculous, ridiculous mainstream presence.  I don’t think you can argue that games aren’t a part of society when it is that big and growing."
Interviewer: Yeah.  You think this is a new thing, I mean they have got mainstream recently, or do you think it’s a longer trend?
Respondent 5: At least in the US it’s been a very hard-fought battle.  I guess going back to like the legal fights with Mortal Combat in the ‘90s and even before that the US gaming industry literally died in the ‘80s because of a couple of shifty games, and it took a long time for it to bounce back.  There was a lot of stagnant, a lot of fear, and even when it came back there was a lot of pushback to them because of – the games were appealing to an older audience, a lot of – when the industry came back it was a lot more diverse content, a lot of it more mature, you know, darker themes or more popular, will be you’re no longer just, you know, Mario going round the Mushroom Kingdom, you’re, you know, fighting for tournaments or you’re leading platoons in World War II or something.  This is very much a very dark gritty topic and a lot of people are very uncomfortable with that because they still viewed the industry as a children’s toy.  A lot of old people, a lot of people who just aren’t educated, who just aren’t familiar with it really try and continue to fight against what they feel is the new devil, you know.
"Respondent 5: It was comic books, it was movies, it was television, it was radio way back in the day.  There’s always something new that’s, you know, coming after imploding society, and video games is, I think, is finally starting to shrug off that mantra.  It hasn’t always been there; I think it’s very much, I don’t know, last – prior ten years that it’s really started to take off and get mainstream, mostly because the world has kind of changed with the internet.  All that weird stuff has just kind of been given a platform, where the old screen, the old style of media wasn’t accepting it, it now had its own platform, which is ballistically massive, like the fourth biggest site in the world.  And the second biggest site in the world, YouTube, its top creator is a gamer, you know. "
Respondent 5: The older world was considered mainstream had a very tentative relationship with it, so they went out and made new video, you know, they created their own part of mainstream because the internet is a beautiful thing and you can do that with it, and I think thanks to that modernisation of entertainment, I think that’s what’s made video games more mainstream.
Interviewer: Okay.  Another thing I would like to ask on this topic, again, because you play RPGs which are very story-driven and you say some games are almost like movies, is whether you think games can be art in themselves or—?
"Respondent 5: I think as far as the question of video games and art goes, I think anyone who says they aren’t is woefully misinformed on the target because look at – look at what goes into video games.  Look at how many people sit there and design.  When you consider what our traditional mainstream art, you know, musicians, artists, you know, people consider like directors and story writers as, you know, a form of art form, video games are all of these things, you know.  You have – like Destiny 2 has like paid composers and stuff making the soundtrack and you have teams of hundreds of people to design these worlds.  They aren’t just, you know, coding ones and zeros into a computer all day; someone actually sat down and drew out, “This is what we want the world to look like.  This character will look like this with these curves,” and all of those things and all these traditionally considered art things, they all exist in video games. "
Respondent 5: The script for like GTA 4 was like 50,000 words or something.  It’s ridiculous.  It’s just there’s a lot that goes into it.  There’s a lot.  If you look at what traditional art is, everything there is in video games.  I think it’s lack of understanding or wilful ignorance for people to say video games are not because they clearly have all components of what a rightful person would think about it.
Interviewer: Okay.  And another thing I wanted to touch on this topic is how do you see the future of video games?  I mean there are technological advances right now, like VR or augmented reality, but even aside from technological advances, games continue to innovate themselves and change, so what do you expect in the future?
Respondent 5: That is a really hard thing to try to grasp because like ten years ago was the start of the – ten years ago since I started with the PlayStation and the 360 thing, a lot of those trends have continued, but no-one would have expected VR to go as massively huge as it did or for the concept of the Nintendo Wii to just basically die out.  Motion controls were a failed experiment, whereas VR at the moment seems to be doing alright.  It’s – and then ten years before that, the PlayStation One era, no-one would have predicted the success of something like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft.  These were just like fantasies in people’s heads at the moment.  This was never a thing that could happen.  
Respondent 5: So from present day kind of to about 10, 15, 20 years, I don’t know.  More good stories should definitely be a thing.  As the industry gets better, more money gets pumped into it, I expect a lot more of these high-level stories, a lot of these amazing sort of gripping tales, more stuff like, you know, more the Final Fantasies, more of like The Last of Us or Horizon, things like that will always have a place because people always like a good story.  Obviously with multiplayer’s not going away, but I think it’ll probably shift focus maybe.  Like I don’t think – I don’t think sports games are going away anywhere anytime soon, but I think it’ll shift more towards, I don’t know, not so much like a casual environment.  I guess probably more eSports-driven would be where competitive is going.
Respondent 5: As far as the industry with like technology, fucked if I know.  I didn’t think VR would be a thing.  I tried some of the earlier – like Oculus Rift when they were still like a death kit and then maybe motion sinking, then, you know, of course five years later they had sold millions of units.  So I really don’t know what will come up.  It’s just one of those things that like I don’t know.  And at E3 this year, it didn’t have any clues because everything was all video games.  You know, XBox got a slight hardware upgrade, but it was just all video games.  
Respondent 5: I’m happy.  Everything that I see that I enjoy in the industry now that has been going for the last five years will continue forwards.  I just don’t know if I could speculate as to what new innovation and thinking can be done, what’s already been tried but failed.  The RPGs have moved forward something for 17, 20 years.  I don’t expect those to be going away any time soon, but what else could come out of that, I don’t know.
Interviewer: Okay.
Respondent 5: Maybe more eSports.  I imagine that if that industry gets kids gathering and seeing what it’s doing, you know, CS:GO events are doing millions of dollars.  Dota 2 hands out like $100 million at some point over the course of its lifetime, so I think there’ll be a lot more of that in video games and a lot of that will be probably more mainstream.  Because the fight for acceptance for video games is as a competitive art form, but beyond that I could not hazard a guess as to [0:50:22].
Interviewer: Okay.  Last thing I wanted to ask you is, you know, we talked a lot about how games are opportunities, potential problems with video games.  Do you think – what advice would you give to different kind of people involved with games to make the situation better?
Respondent 5: Oh, don’t underestimate the audience would be probably my biggest thing.  And what you take away from that will depend on where in the industry you’re trying to focus.  But in a broad sense a lot of people will look at the video games industry as, you know, free money, as a cash cow or the consumers are ignorant and they will buy whatever you put in front of them because, you know, some games that look stupid on paper make billions of dollars, you know, like Pokémon Go, like someone wants to actually walk around and flick balls at a screen, biggest selling app of the goddamn planet, so I think a lot of people tend to overestimate the audience and try to feel like they know what’s best.  They feel like they can tell people what the audience will buy, what they won’t going forward.  
"Respondent 5: And I think that is something that has been the bane of a lot of gaming to this point and if I had to give any advice, it would be that, to take a critical look at your audience and what you’re looking in towards.  Gaming isn’t some solitary mass with one feeling, one direction; it’s a homogenous sort of gathering of people with all sorts of various types and flavours and hobbies, things of that nature.  You can’t just log us all as one unit; you have to select what you’re going for, then you have to understand the audience of what you’re going for.  If you’re making an RPG, we don’t want, you know, World War II shooter or something.  That’s just disrespectful to the people you’re trying to get money out of and the fans will respond accordingly.  If you try to disrespect us, we just won’t buy your shit and your company goes under."
Respondent 5: If you’re trying to lead a community or something, you have to understand not just about the fans, what the companies are looking for, they have a product that they’re trying to get out there to as many people.  And even if it’s a good product, if there’s no message behind it, the product goes away.  So you have to understand your audience, whether that’s the gamers or the industry as a whole, you need to understand it and you need to not take it for granted.  That’s my – that would be my advice.
Interviewer: Okay.  Is there something you would suggest to players?
Respondent 5: My advice to players is probably to be more understanding, because at the moment the player community, despite it being as large and as mainstream as I believe it is now, they play – a lot of the smaller communities will feel that way, because their small corner of the industry isn’t massive, you know, it’s just one part of the giant thing as a whole, so a lot of people get very defensive of their products and it creates to very – a lot of misunderstandings or a lot of unneeded aggression.  
Respondent 5: The success of the games industry as a whole is good for every player, regardless of platform.  For example, you know, Halo settling millions of dollars on XBox can only ever mean a good thing, even if all you play is card games on theme because that means there’s more industry.  There’s more eyes on it.  There’s more people focused on it.  Even if someone doesn’t like Halo, they’re like, you know, there’s a lot of money here.  We could probably put something out that could capture some of that opportunity.
Respondent 5: So to players, that’s my thought.  Be more understanding of the community, of the players coming into it.  The industry’s growing.  You’re always having new people come into it.  You don’t want to put them off by being racist or misogynist or just generally just a toxic person.  Everybody wants to get into the game at some point and not everyone’s going to be good at the game and just default mode being, you know, rage and go away doesn’t help, so that’s my suggestion to any sort of player is try to be more understanding.  
Respondent 5: And the industry as a whole, because it is a massive cluster-fuck of change at the moment and to players because of a similar reason, because it’s expanding and everyone has to get in at the ground floor and you want to make sure that they want to stay in that floor if you want everything to unite.
Interviewer: Okay.  So, we are at the end of the interview.  Is there anything you want to add that came into your mind that you didn’t know when to say or—?
"Respondent 5: Not really.  The one constant part is I just like video games.  I think – I feel like that’s the mind-set of a lot of people.  This isn’t some sort of, you know, thing; this is their life.  This is their passion, their chosen form of entertainment, for better or good, if that’s, you know, playing the game or, you know, reading reviews, watching streamers on Twitch or other websites, like I do, or if you’re actually participating in part of that community, that’s all we want.  All we want is good games.  We just want games to play.  We want to have fun with our friends, and that’s – that can’t be a bad thing, regardless of – even if games aren’t your chosen form of entertainment, if you’re a movie buff or whatever, I don’t – you know, it shouldn’t be a bad thing that people are getting enjoyment out of something else.  It’s a different game or if it’s a different entertainment medium in general, you know, people just want to enjoy their things.  So that’s my thought."
Interviewer: So, thank you a lot for your time and for your insights.  And if you are interested, I will send you our output after we have analysed the interviews and…

Interview 6:
Interviewer: I will explain to you how this interview works.  As I said, we’re interested in your experience as a gamer and your opinion about how games influence us.  During the interview I will share these PowerPoint slides, you should be able to see them.
Respondent 6: Yes.
Interviewer: They will help us guide our conversation and there will be some keywords which you are free to use as cues to guide your thoughts, but you are not required to follow them.  They are just to help you and it’s not a rigid structure of the interview.  Do you have any questions about the interview?
Respondent 6: No,  not really.  If it helps I’m a grad student, so I just finished up my academics and I’m about to start field work so I know research.  I understand how difficult one, it is to actually get people and two, to actually get through everything. (Laughs)
Interviewer: We will begin by talking about your experience with games, so which kind of games do you play?  How much do you play?
Respondent 6: Right now in my life I mostly play – I play League of Legends, so like a MOBA, and then on top of that I play visual novels.  Right now I’m playing Persona 5, I play the Playstation Vita games, Danganronpa is one of my favourites.  It’s a lot less – I don’t play so much action heavy things anymore, just because I don’t have time for it (laughs).  Because I have school, I have my field work coming up, so I just try to fit in what I can.  If it’s anything I can pick up and immediately put down and it’s okay if I don’t pick it up for a little while.  Pretty much the only actiony games that I really play right now, I still pick up Skyrim every once in a while and I will play Dishonoured 2.   Then also I have simulators.  So I’ll use like Nintendo Emulator, I’ll play any of those games any day.
Interviewer: And how much did you say you played in a typical day?
Respondent 6: In a typical day—
Interviewer: Or a week, I don’t know what’s—
Respondent 6: It ranges between nothing to upwards of maybe three hours.  It depends on the game.  Like if I’m playing League of Legends and I’m playing with my friends a game can last anywhere from a half hour to forty minutes and we may play three of those.  Then we’ll get fed up and leave it alone.  Then playing Persona or Danganronpa I could easily play for five hours with that, just because I’m into the story.  If I can sink five hours into a book then I can do the same for a visual novel.  But I’d say definitely less than how much I can actually play in a day, just because I have other obligations.  Sort of growing up I guess. 
Interviewer: You said you played both single player and multi player, right?
Respondent 6: Yes.
Interviewer: When playing multi player do you play only with your friends or also with people you don’t know?
Respondent 6: I play a lot with people I don’t know.  Like if no one’s online that I know then you have to play with random people when playing League.  On top of that there are people that I only know on the internet, that I’ve never met in real life, I don’t know what they sound like, I don’t know if they are male or female, how old they are, it’s just people that I will consistently play with just because we have similar play strategies.
Interviewer: And do you only play on the computer or do you also—
Respondent 6: No, I play on the computer, I currently have my fiancé’s PS4, so I’m using that.  I have a Playstation Vita.  I own every single Game Boy ever made.  I have a Super Nintendo, I have a Nintendo 64, I have a Playstation 2, I have an XBox 360 and I still play all of those.
Interviewer: Very multi-platform, okay (laughs).
Respondent 6: I have switched more to PC now, just because I don’t like spending six hundred dollars to just start playing new games.  (Laughs)  When I can just update a graphics card, I’d rather do that than actually have to go out and buy an entirely new system.
Interviewer: Do you spend a lot on video games, if you don’t mind me asking?
Respondent 6: I honestly can't say how much I would spend in a year.  I’d definitely say that I spend probably less than two hundred dollars on average in a year.  My computer was an undergraduate graduation gift from my fiancé.  My games I normally get Christmas presents, birthday presents, my friends will get them for me whenever there’s a sale, we’ll get each other games.  But I’d say definitely less than two or three hundred dollars a year.
Interviewer: Since when do you play?  How old were you?
Respondent 6: How long I’ve been playing?  Like when I started playing video games?
Interviewer: Yeah.
Respondent 6: I was little.  I was probably – one of my earliest memories is being around three, four years old and sitting on my dad’s lap and him showing me how to play Mario on the Super Nintendo.  I’ve been playing video games for a long, long time (laughs), so I’ve been playing for over twenty years.
Interviewer: That’s a lot of time (laughs).
Respondent 6: Yeah.
Interviewer: This leads us to the second thing we want to explore.  How do you feel games have influenced you?  Do you think they have influenced you and in what way?
Respondent 6: I think there are several ways that I can look at this.  The first thing that comes to mind is the actual physical way that they’ve influenced me.  I feel like my reaction times are a lot better, I feel like I’m good at bimanual tasks.  I’m an occupational therapy student so I like hands a lot.  We were going over different tests that we would use with clients and one of them is a Purdue Pegboard test where we form little assemblies.  So it’s like a peg, a washer, a nut, a washer, and then you have to disassemble it.  And they’re very, very tiny and all of my test scores for that were above average.  I blew everyone out of the water in my class, and I think that’s because I play video games.  It’s because I have really good fine motor manipulation because of that.  And because I play a variety of games, a variety of different tools for that, I have the [Yoshi gun 0:08:32] and everything, I have a Super Nintendo arcade board.  So just different ways that I’ve improved my own hand strength from that.
Respondent 6: When it comes to anything social, I feel like I have benefited from it.  Not so much that – there’s this vague misconception that gamers really don’t have any social skills, but I feel like because I play video games I have a better understanding of social skills than anyone else.  I never got into trouble because you won't get into trouble if you just play video games.  My friends played video games so I always had something in common.  I feel like I don’t talk to as many girls as other girls maybe would, because of it, I feel that’s one of the downsides, I don’t get a lot of other women.  I would always immediately go and talk to guys, they like video games, there was something to talk about with them.  I never used to listen to pop songs or anything so I’d never have anything to talk to girls about.  So there’s that.
Respondent 6: And I met my fiancé through video games because we went to university together and we were both in the scholars programme.  At my school there’s a scholars and honours lounge and we had a Nintendo Wii that the students convinced the faculty to buy for them.  And we used to play all the games and we had additional remotes and batteries.  So there would always be someone in there playing Super Smash Bros, and when I was a freshman I would just sit there and watch them and then eventually he coaxed me in to start playing with them and everything.  And we eventually started dating and blah, blah, blah.  So I think that video games have been a very important part of my life and they’ve helped me get to where I am now.
Interviewer: I will show you the keywords we were thinking about when we are thinking about this part of the interview.  Something you already touched upon, so you said you benefited from a physical skill standpoint?
Respondent 6: Yeah.  And even you say like the cognitive and the perceptual abilities, yes, definitely.  I know that my problem solving is above average, I know that I have really, really good memory for things like numbers.  I used to participate in psychological studies in my undergrad and I made one research a little mad because they were having me repeat back numbers after listening to them and I got up to like eighteen numbers.  And they were just like, thanks for being an outlier, kid!
Interviewer: Is it something you carry outside of video games to?
Respondent 6: Yes, definitely.  Attention, I feel that one I’m a little – I can't be counted on that one because I have ADHD.  So I can always pay attention to video games but other things not so much without my medication.  So there’s that.  When it comes to physical activity, I don’t really have an issue with that because I go to the gym whenever I can.  I’d be so aware of that more than anything, not so much video games.  Especially since like I was a kid, when I was almost a teenager we had Dance, Dance Revolution so all of us were always doing that.  Collaboration and competition, that I feel League of Legends comes into that, Halo comes into play with that.  I’m always impressed by how in League you’re on five man teams and you have to immediately come up with some sort of teamwork and communication.  You have to collaborate with four other complete strangers in order to actually win.  Which is difficult sometimes when you’ve got someone that is not a team player, but you’ve always got to try and make it work.  
Respondent 6: Competition, I do like the competition of League, that’s why I keep playing it.  Other things not so much.  But just the idea of getting better and improving skill and kicking the other team’s butt (laughs).  Emersion and engagement.  I wouldn’t say that I get emersion into games all that often.  I’m always very centred in real life so I never really lose sight of that.  I never go, man, I wish I was this world instead of this world.  I have my dog, I have my family, I’d rather be here than there.  But that doesn’t really hinder the sort of engagement that I have of games.  Like I can play mostly anything except for certain types of indie games, I’m not into that.
Respondent 6: As long as there’s some sort of good graphics to it or they’re the kind of graphics that withstand the test of time I’m okay with it.  If there’s really pixelated graphics I can't play it, that’s where emersion breaks for me.
Interviewer: So that’s an important point for you, okay.
Respondent 6: And then addiction.  I know that there are some people that can be very easily addicted to video games.  I don’t feel like I have an addictive personality.  I’m very good at picking something up, obsessing over it for about two weeks and then just dropping it completely and never looking at it again, as noted by the amiibo sitting in front of my face.  So yeah, I don’t feel like video game addiction is a thing for me, I don’t have an issue with that.
Interviewer: But you do think that some people do?
Respondent 6: Yes, absolutely.
Interviewer: So the next thing I wanted to explore is whether you can think about practical application of video games.  So using video games not only for entertainment but—
Respondent 6: Absolutely.  As an occupational therapist one of the things I look forward to in practice, because I want to be in paediatrics, I want to work with kids, I want to be able to include video games into the intervention plans that I will probably set up for kids.  I feel like video games are something that kids really can't get away from nowadays.  Like when I was a kid you had to have the system.  But now every parent has a Smartphone, almost every kid has a tablet, there’s some sort of video game that these kids are playing.  Already we incorporate video games into practice because we have little games that do tracing and teaching letters, numbers, how to write, things like that.  
Respondent 6: There was research at my school about using Guitar Hero for hand rehabilitation and I have so down with that (laughs).  I remember hearing about a musician using that, his hand was either broken or burnt and he did that.  That’s something that I really want to be able to do some research supporting it.  That’s just for the physical application of it, that’s just for look at this poor fine motor control, poor grip strength, learning how to play video games.  When you’re playing a game you’re getting so into it you’re just gripping the controller with all your strength, that’s helping a kid sometimes.  That’s helping them a lot, that’s helping them with their fine motor manipulation and everything.
Respondent 6: When it comes to education, I mean, I don't know so much about video games in the sense of things like the computer, on a platform.  Because I remember growing up with the kids’ games that taught you how to read.  To a point, yeah, they did help but at the same time I feel like they were more – like I could figure out the pattern and then I didn’t really have to pay that much attention to the application of it.  I didn’t have to actually learn, I could figure out the pattern.  Right now, I feel like apps could kind of help just because you could change it that way.  It might not be so much of a pattern and it could be a little more learning versus just memorisation.  So there’s that.  I’m thinking right now because I’m using the Duolingo app and I’m practising German and Japanese and everything. 
Interviewer: You touched actually a lot of the things we were thinking of.  You are the first one to propose games for rehabilitation actually (laughs) among the people we interviewed.
Respondent 6: That’s my major.  The first thing that I think of with everything.
Interviewer: Of course (laughs).  But also I am interested in your experience with games in school.  Because do you know in your mind what could be done to make them more effective in this regard?
Respondent 6: To touch on that, I think that it depends on the population that you’re going to be working with.  If you’re going to be working with a classically normal child, average child, then I’m not too sure how effective they would be.  Or rather I feel that you could make them more difficult and it will go over better.  But if you’re working with a child with severe issues, with severe cognitive delay, anything like that, something that I’ve noticed just working with kids is they, one, no matter how severe a child may look they are always smarter than you ever expect.  I worked with a little girl with a severe seizure disorder and we were trying to teach her how to write, we were using an iPad app.  
Respondent 6: And it wasn’t so much we felt she was learning the letters, it was more that she practised it so many times in therapy that she just memorised it.  And it wasn’t helping her as much.  I feel like if there’s a physical application of it in addition to the virtual, that might be better.  But then at the same time if you’re working with a kid with such severe delays they might not have the physical capabilities to actually do the physical.  It’s difficult because it’s so new for therapy that there’s not that many people actually using it outside of those iPad apps.  So it’s a little hard to say where in the world it can go when we’re not really sure where we’re going to be moving with it for the next three years.
Interviewer: I also wanted to ask, are you familiar with the term gamification?
Respondent 6: Gamification.  I can't say that I am, but I can venture a guess.  Making things into games when they don’t have to be?
Interviewer: In essence we define it as using game elements outside of a game, a real game.  So for example, Duolingo which you cited is an example of gamification, because you are learning a language and there are some game elements.  Like you accumulate experience you get – that is something that we categorise as gamification.  So those apps that you use to track your running and make it something of a competition with your friends.  What do you think of those kind of applications, since you had some experience with Duolingo?
Respondent 6: For me personally it does nothing.  I do not care about achievements.  The only time I care about achievements is if it’s a game that I like.  Like for Dishonoured, Dishonoured 2, Skyrim, I shoot for getting all of those achievements.  When it comes to my FitBit app I couldn’t care less.  I don’t care.  I like that it shows me – when I say I’m going to get ten thousand steps today it shows me how many steps I have.  The aesthetic of it is pleasing but the actual application of it towards me as a person could not be – I am not at the same level as it at all.  I don’t care.  My fiancé cares very much, he’s a completionist, he’s perfectionist about it, so he cares about it.  For some people it works, for me it is not a motivational tool at all.  Because I’m just like, I don’t really care if I get this, if I get it it’s great, if I don’t, whatever.  Like the Duolingo app, I mean, woo, on level 5, I still can't speak it (laughs).  For me I need actual results, not just a screen telling me I did it.
Interviewer: Also I don’t know if you are familiar with the term serious games?
Respondent 6: Not really.
Interviewer: By serious games we just mean those games that were not built for entertainment.  You know, you want to use games for learning for example you could use a commercial game, like Portal has been used for example.
Respondent 6: Portal has been used?
Interviewer: Yeah, there are some studies about that.  That’s the application of an entertainment game.  Or you could build a game specifically for learning, we would call that serious game because it doesn’t have the primary purpose of entertainment.
Respondent 6: Okay, so even if it is a typically entertaining game, if it’s not being used for the purpose of entertainment it’s classed as a serious game?
Interviewer: Not really.  I mean, if it’s built for entertainment and we use it for something else, yeah, that’s an applied game but not a serious game.  If you create it for learning, for example, or for physical rehabilitation, we consider it a serious game.  Which of course can be entertaining (laughs).
Respondent 6: But it’s not the primary objective of the game.
Interviewer: Yeah.
Respondent 6: That one’s tricky.  I feel like when it comes to a that sort of genre of game you would be looking at a population of probably parents trying to make their kids a little more interested in learning in school, you’d be looking at therapy, working with kids.  You could even push it towards adults.  I think that’s a fine line.  I think that it would have to be very – not only would it have to be very aesthetically pleasing, it would also have to be very quick to judge the skill level and adjust accordingly.  Because it has to fit the just right challenge for it.  If it’s not difficult enough people are going to lose interest in it and if it’s too difficult people interested in it get frustrated with it.  The entertainment value would be a moot point unless you get that just right challenge.
Interviewer: That’s maybe something all games have to do, even entertainment games can be frustrating or too easy and boring.
Respondent 6: Yeah, it is.
Interviewer: But you think it is more important in that kind of context?
Respondent 6: Yes.  Just because if you’re going to be using it in order for someone to learn something and to gain new skills, that’s incredibly important, the just right challenge is a therapy model.  We say it a lot when we’re coming up with intervention plans for patients and clients.  We want to make sure that it’s challenging enough that they’re going to get improvements but no so challenging that they get frustrated and quit, not too easy that they think they’re not doing anything.  
Interviewer: So I will move to our fourth topic, which are ethical issues.  So if you see any ethical issue in the use of games or even in the message games convey?
Respondent 6: I feel that there are people out there that look for things, that look for issues in games that might not necessarily be there.  I feel that there are games out there that you have ethical issues.  The first game that comes to mind is that Steam Hatred game.  I’m not particularly a fan of the development of that, the message behind that.  I get that people are upset about it.  But if you look at it it’s kind of a crappy game and that speaks for itself I think.  It’s a dumb game, that’s part of the problem with it.  But, I mean, it’s one of those things where if you’re looking for ethical issues you’re going to find ethical issues but if you’re looking to just play the game and enjoy the game you’re going to be fine with it.  
Respondent 6: When it comes to obvious ethical issues in a game, like not, you know, the developers having ethical issues and conflict of interest and everything, but actually having an ethical choice.  Like Dishonoured you can do the lethal route or you can do non lethal.  I’m a pansy and I always go non.  I try to make myself do lethal and I just can't do it, because deep down I’m like, I don’t want to kill people.  So there’s that.  Other ethical issues I can see pertaining to games like [Earth Infection 0:28:17] make me mad.  Bethesda E3 just had Creation Club.
Interviewer: Yeah, I heard about it.
Respondent 6: With credit that you have to purchase and didn’t they learn anything from Steam.  (Laughs)  Don’t put out a AAA game, price it at sixty dollars and expect people to do micro-transactions, I think that’s an ethical issue.  If you like the mods that people are putting out, hire them.  
Interviewer: Did you ever use micro-transaction?
Respondent 6: Yes.
Interviewer: I mean, you play League of Legends which has them.
Respondent 6: Yeah, there’s micro-transactions.  If I see a skin that I want, I’m just like, how much money do I have?  Yeah, I can afford five dollars.  I really don’t want to grind up the IP to actually get a new champion, they’re on sale, why not?  That, it’s a free game and have sunk so many hours into it that my thought process is, okay, how much money would I be spending on a AAA game?  Sixty dollars, and I’ll probably get like twenty-five hours of game play, just straight game play out of, not just screwing around.  Okay, I can afford to spend this much on a game that I’ve spent this much time on.  So I’m okay with that.
Interviewer: So you think that kind of model is okay.  So a free game which you could buy something?
Respondent 6: Yeah.  I don’t like the micro-transactions, I don’t like app micro-transactions, where it’s like, you probably play this game this many times a day because you don’t want to buy the tokens or whatever, you’d rather just waste time.  I hate that.  If I want to play a game I’m going to binge it for a little while but don’t make me pay to do it.  The exception to that is if it’s like an actually well made game and I appreciate it.  And I’m like, yeah, I really like this game, it’s well made, they’re not pushing ads at me all the time, I’ll drop a couple of bucks.  But I will say that I am a member of Google Opinion Rewards, so I get money for surveys that I fill out.  And I only spend that on apps, so it’s not even my own money. 
Interviewer: So you have a kind of a rule to decide how to spend it?
Respondent 6: Yeah.
Interviewer: That’s interesting.  
Respondent 6: I try not to spend my own money on like micro-transactions. If there’s a skin on League that I want I’m going to buy it because life’s too short.  What are the other options?  Gender, identity and diversity, race.  That I understand that I am a standard white female.  Whatever, take my opinion for what you will, I do not give a crap about gender and race in video games.  I’m playing a game, my character is black, woo, if it’s a woman, woo, if it’s a transgender, woo.  I don’t care.  So if the game itself is good I don’t give a crap about what the protagonist simulated characters are.  I don’t care, that’s not an issue for me.  
Respondent 6: I don’t care that in Dishonoured 2 I play as a female versus a male, it doesn’t matter, I don’t see her face, I just hear her voice every so often saying weird little things.  It just doesn’t matter to me, it’s not a priority to me, I’m still going to play the game.  It doesn’t matter.  Violence and aggression.  Games are violent and aggressive.  I feel that for kids that can be impressionable but as an adult it’s fine.  I don’t think that me playing video games has made me overtly aggressive or violent.  I don’t think that that’s really affected me in that way.  Mostly because I know the difference between right and wrong and I can apply that as such.  I don’t need to be violent or aggressive to properly express myself.
Interviewer: That’s interesting.  Because you said that in a way violence disturbs you a little in a game, did I get that right?  
Respondent 6: Yeah.  
Interviewer: You said in Dishonoured, you automatically chose the peaceful path.
Respondent 6: I know.  That is something where I don’t like getting bad endings in video games, and I know that if I play the aggressive out in video games I’m going to get the bad ending.  I don’t want to see everybody suffer.  I think that’s just who I am.  When it comes to something like League I’m going to murder the entire team, it’s one of those things where it’s like the end, to win, and there’s no reason why my morality changes anything, done.  But if my game is going to challenge me to play one way or the other and the ending is going to be the result of that, I’m going to be like, oh crap, I don’t want to see what the bad ending is going to be and who’s going to die, I like these characters.
Interviewer: So it’s more of a matter of consequences in the game?  Okay.  (Laughs)
Respondent 6: Yeah.  Piracy, I don’t pirate games, I don’t care if other people pirate games, what you do with your life is your business.  I think what I do with my life is my own.  So I don’t particularly care if other people pirate.  Do I think it’s wrong?  Sure, I guess.  I know one of my friends will pirate games but then if he really likes it he buys it.  So it’s one of those things I understand why some people pirate games, especially if it’s something like my friend does where he wants to try it before he buys it.  I would hate to spend fifty, sixty dollars on a game, realise I hate it and then not be able to return it and get all of my money back.  So there’s that.
Respondent 6: Other than that I understand when they say piracy is an issue, people need to get paid, it’s peoples’ jobs.  Where I work, because I still work in a grocery store, I get mad when people steal things and it’s essentially the same thing, just intellectual property.  Yeah.  so I wouldn’t do it, I don’t care if other people do it.  Yes, I understand that it’s wrong but I also see why people do it.  I just wouldn’t.
Respondent 6: What are your question about that?  What do you mean about inclusion?
Interviewer: For example, in the gaming community if you feel there are dynamics of exclusion or if you feel the community can be inclusive.  This I think not completely but is a little connected to the topics highlighted in diversity.  But it’s less about the game and more about the gamers, you know.
Respondent 6: I feel like that can sort of be seen in League more so than any AAA game or any game that you would playing on a console, it’s something where you’d see that a lot more in any multi player game versus any single player or story driven game.  I can tell you that when I play League everyone assumes that I’m a guy, the community that I talk to, with my little club that I’m in that we all play with, everybody thinks that I’m a guy named Nick.  I did not tell them that, they all just assumed that based off my username because apparently no one’s ever seen Monty Python.  My user name is NiKnight and everybody calls me Nick, even though it’s the knights who say “Ni.”  
Respondent 6: But they all think that I’m a guy and it’s like, “What’s up, brother?  What’s up, dude?”  That sort of thing.  And I’m just like, I don’t feel like correcting you, let’s just roll with this.  When I was playing Halo online, I wouldn’t even play with the sound on half the time, or with my voice chat on, because I didn’t feel like having people not really yell at me because I was a girl but be like, oh my God, you’re a girl, and I hate that so much.  Why are you so shocked that there’s a girl playing a video game?  It’s not the end of the world.
Interviewer: Still in the kind of games you play girls are still in the minority, did I get that right?
Respondent 6: Yeah, girls are very much still in the minority.  
Interviewer: Because I was also a little – I remember at the beginning of the interview you said you feel you have video games in common with guys…
Respondent 6: Yeah.
Interviewer: …and you don’t talk much with girls.  I mean, not as often as other girls, because you don’t feel you have that in common with them.
Respondent 6: Right.
Interviewer: So that’s interesting, because, you know, there have been some statistics about the number of girls playing video games and it’s not that unbalanced. 
Respondent 6: I know.
Interviewer: But maybe it is among [0:39:03] of video games, so probably League of Legends is still mostly males.
Respondent 6: That’s even reflective in the LCS.  I mean, how often do you see girls in LCS?  I can remember once.  I think the 2016 spot when there was actually a girl on, I don’t even remember what team it was because she hid her face half the time, she had a bandana across her face.  I think she denied letting them turn her camera on during the game because she’s just had so much harassment from the community as a whole.
Interviewer: Really?
Respondent 6: It’s unnecessary.  Like people were calling her a transsexual and everything, and so what, who cares?  She calls herself a girl, she’s a girl.  Social justice.  The only thing I can think of with that is Gamergate.  (Laughs)  That was a bad time, my fiancé had a tough time with that.  He was so upset because he just wanted his video game news and he was just getting Gamergate.  I rarely ever apply social justice to video games.  The only thing I can say about it is I prefer not to have objectified in games, which is really hard, but at the same time it doesn’t bug me that much.  I just really don’t like it when they have – if they have a portrait of females that’s really dumb and ditzy then I’m just like, really, you couldn’t have come up with a better characterisation for them?
Interviewer: Yeah, but you are not that annoyed by it I mean?
Respondent 6: Yeah.  I’m playing the game to have fun, I’m not playing the game to find issues with it.  That’s just me, I don’t play a game to try and pick out all of the issues and the ethics that they might have violated.  It’s a game, just let me have fun.  
Interviewer: Moving on, we are nearing the end of the interview.  This is probably the most abstract thing in the interview, but how do you see or feel that games influence society?  If you believe they do?
Respondent 6: Well, I think games have influenced society a little bit.  I think as a society we have all become more open and accepting of video games.  Like way back when, I remember, oh, you can't play this game, it’s not – I was never allowed to play T rated games when I was ten years old.  So I wasn’t thirteen yet, I couldn’t play a game.  Now you see – here you see in GameStop, you will see a ten year old kid go in there with his dad or his mom and they will buy Call of Duty for them, an M rated game for a ten year old, and then they go and they play online.  That is terrible, I hate that.  
Respondent 6: That’s something that I really wish we would go back to the old ways of, you’re ten, you can't play a mature game yet because I feel like that is just poor parenting for one.  That and when I would play Halo a lot, that was one of the things I hated was when there was a screechy ten year old on there and they would just be freaking out about everything.  Like, I am too old for this.  I feel like there’s that, where people are a little more open to games and that can be a good and a bad thing with parents letting their children play games that they shouldn’t be playing with adults.
Respondent 6: Then going back to the society being more open to video games, if you look at phone apps, most people have some sort of game on their phone.  I will always yell at my mom when she was like, you shouldn’t be playing video games all the time and I’m like, what are you doing right now, mom?  I’m on my phone.  What are you playing?  Shut up. (Laughs)  I can kind of throw that back in peoples’ faces now when they’re like, why are you playing a video game?  And I’m like, oh I’m sorry, do you have Angry Birds on your phone?  Don’t talk to me about this.  
Respondent 6: It’s just I feel like there’s been an extreme increase in casual gamers, phone gamers, people that just sit there and play apps on their phones.  My dad is big on this, he plays a lot of games on his tablet. I generally can't keep a game on my tablet for more than two weeks, or on my phone for more than two weeks until I just delete because I can't take it anymore.  Because almost everything has micro-transactions.  So I just get mad and delete it.
Interviewer: I’m just a little curious though that I have this feeling from both your interview and the interview I’ve done that mobile games are seen as something different from all other kind of games.
Respondent 6: They really are.  And they’re just the same.  It’s just on a touch screen.  People do really consider them two different things.  Oh, it’s not a video game, it’s a phone game, it’s an app.  I can download a video game onto my XBox does that make it an app?  So yeah.  I mean, even when – because I know at least on the Apple apps store you can download 999 which is an old DS game.  And you can play it on your phone but it’s a legitimate video game, like Nintendo put out this game, it’s on the DS, I have the cartridge, but someone can download it on their phone and then suddenly it’s an app and it’s not the same thing.  That’s just ridiculous.  
Respondent 6: Yeah, I agree, I one hundred percent agree that people seem to think that phone games are not the same thing as video games even though it’s literally all the same elements, you just don’t have – it’s just not as story driven as most video games.  It’s very stop and go.  It’s essentially like playing Minecraft on your computer, like you know the old XP Pinball, kind of like that.  Pinball Wizard or whatever it was on Windows XP.  That’s about all I can come up with off the top of my head.  Oh, cultural changes.
Respondent 6: Marketing, I don’t like hook into marketed, I’ve never been a big fan of that because they – now they’re actually saying – I don’t remember them ever saying this before, because the Star Wars Battlefront II stuff is coming out, the trailers for it and everything and now it actually says, in game footage.  Whereas before they would show you cut scene animations which were always beautiful and then you actually play the game and you’re like, this is not as beautiful as I expected (laughs).  That would always make me mad, this is false advertising.  This game doesn’t actually look like this, only five percent of it does.  
Respondent 6: I don’t really feel like marketing has gotten more – I don’t want to say malicious because that’s not the right word for it, but that’s sort of like targeted and really persuasive.  I think it’s really a lot more of that, look what we’ve got, play with your friends, versus before like in the 90s and early 2000s games were like, the companies would really push towards kids.  They’d really push towards, all of your friends are going to have this and you’re going to be left out, you need this game, you need this system, make sure your parents get you this system and I feel like they’re really stepped away from that. 
Respondent 6: Another thing I feel like the marketing has changed is you don’t see a lot of kids alone playing video games.  When you see the commercials, you either see the video game itself or – for the Nintendo Switch you rarely see just kids playing the Switch, you see adults and kids or just straight adults playing it.  Which I think is very interesting, because I don’t remember it ever being like that.  I still have all the Nintendo Power magazines where it’s like you see two kids on the front playing Super Nintendo or Nintendo 64, it was never marketed towards adults, it was always marketed towards kids.
Interviewer: Yeah, I never noticed this shift, but yeah.
Respondent 6: That was a recent thing that I’ve noticed.  Art and games.  I think that some video games are just – they’re gorgeous, and some of the art within the games are just spectacular.  Like I know for one, when I finally move out of my parents and move in with my fiancé, I’ve already got stuff in a cart that I’m going to buy because I want like video game decorations all around me.  Even stuff straight out of games.  I want some of those paintings from Dishonoured that Delilah and Sokolov have made because they are just gorgeous.  And somebody actually took the time to make those and it’s obvious.  
Respondent 6: I want some of the posters that are in games.  I plan on making a shadow box, because I own every single Game Boy and I want to make a shadow box out of that and hang it on the wall and have it be like art.  It’s one of those where it’s its own little thing, like you’d never see it in an art museum.  Not yet at least, who knows a hundred years down the road.  But it’s definitely one of those things where people have started taking it and made it their own and used it to really define their lives.  When you walk into their house you see what interests them and it’s almost like making video games into art, they can do that.  I don't know if that’s where you were going with that?
Interviewer: That’s okay.
Respondent 6: But that’s how I interpret it. 
Interviewer: Regulation you already touched upon, talking about the control by parents and also—
Respondent 6: Also with regulation, I feel like I remember seeing something about – I can't remember.   Can't remember what else I was going to say about regulation.  I know there’s parental regulation.  The ESRB, that could be – I wish there was a little bit oomph behind that.  There’s nothing that they wouldn’t do, but I wish that even if the kid has parent permission I really wish they couldn’t play M rated games.  I think that’s just bad news.
Interviewer: You think it’s too little regulated now?
Respondent 6: It’s a fine line.  It’s a very fine line between someone’s own agency and someone telling them, no, you can't do this.  Like you can't – at least here in America, you can't really infringe on a parent’s ability to govern their child’s life.  They look at you with this look on their face like you’re the scum of the earth, like how dare you tell me I can't do this to my child.  And like you could not do that in America right now at all, even though I feel like we should.  I think there’s not enough regulation in it right now but I also don’t see a proper resolution to that any time in the near future.
Interviewer: You don’t see how it could be implemented in the US culture I will say (laughs).
Respondent 6: I feel like other people might have better thoughts on that. (Laughs)  
Interviewer: The last thing—  Go on.
Respondent 6: I was going to say, now I can say something about the cultural changes, just the whole before I remember there used to be these things where parents were really strict, religious parents, wouldn’t let kids play games, they’re just like, no, the devil will take you, that used to be a thing.  And it was hilarious, like people don’t get Monster because the devil will take them (laughs).  But I feel like there’s a whole culture here in America and probably worldwide that’s become a little more accepting of video games.  For God’s sakes, we have eSports now.  I never expected that to come, even though South Korea has been doing it for ages with StarCraft.  I mean, I never, never expected eSports to take off like it has at all.  And even to have the NBA teams, like the owners of the basketball teams in America buy eSports teams is just mind-blowing.  Like oh my God what is going on?
Interviewer: I didn’t know that.
Respondent 6: Yes, oh my God.  Like you know Echo Fox?  The team Echo Fox is owned by Rick Fox who is a former basketball player from the Lakers.  Like what?  And he’s just like, I’m gonna go buy an eSports team.  So he buys an eSports team and he has [Frogget 0:55:04], like, okay, that’s cool.  And then their delta team, their challenger series team, has like the top five strapers.  It’s a brilliant marketing route because everybody loves them, there’s a team full of them, it’s just going to be a [0:55:23] now.  But yeah, basketball team owners are buying eSports leagues and sponsoring them and everything and putting money into this.  It’s just insane how much it has taken off.  [0:55:39] (laughs).  Sorry.  But also, occasionally you will see eSports played in sports bars in America, sometimes.  It’s rare but sometimes if there’s nothing else going on they’ll put it on.
Interviewer: That’s really curious.
Respondent 6: I think someone requests it, but I think they’ll still put it on the TV.  Also, innovation in games, I like where games are going and how we’re moving towards VR.  One of the things that interests me as a therapist and gamer is the whole using virtual reality to help people.  One of the things that I feel will really, really benefit people is full emersion, and I feel like that’s really going to help combat veterans and people with PTSD, either in children that have experienced traumatic events, because it will be in a safe environment but they will also at the same time be fully immersed in the experience.  I feel that that can really help them to get over – not really get over, but accept past trauma and move forward in their lives with that.  
Respondent 6: There’s been a lot of research on it, I’ve tried to find some, but it’s really hard.  At the time when the research was being conducted video games were not what they are today.  They certainly did not have the Oculus Rift, they certainly did not have the Vive or whatever it is.  
Interviewer: But it’s been a recent development?
Respondent 6: Yeah, very recent.  And the research community has not really looked into it enough.  But I feel like the innovation in games is going to have an overlap into medicine that will really help especially therapy and psychology, I think it’ll be good for that.  Especially if they can incorporate smell too, a big one.  I mean, really if you’re in a therapy setting and you’re dedicated to this it wouldn’t be that difficult.  But that’s not something – I can't see it right now or even in the next five years incorporating smell into—
Interviewer: It would be a little difficult.
Respondent 6: They’re still working on the whole like being able to move and play VR at the same time.  I also think that’s going to be good too, the movement with VR, I feel like that will help some people.  Because especially people who don’t leave their houses might get some exercise, it depends.  But I’m actually really excited for that to happen because I will totally test that out some more.  I don’t know if I’d ever buy it but I mean, I would like to try that because it’s really interesting to have that sort of treadmill apparatus that you’re strapped to, having the VR headset on.
Interviewer: Have you ever tried VR yourself?
Respondent 6: No.  I almost did, I went – do you know what PAX is here?  
Interviewer: No.
Respondent 6: It’s the Penny Arcade Expo, Penny Arcade is in [0:59:29] and they have their own little conventions.  They have like three in the US and one in Australia.  I went to PAX East which is in Boston, Massachusetts a couple of years ago and they had the Oculus Rift there for people to try.  But they didn’t tell you right away that there was an app you had to download and sign your name on so you could get on the list to actually get into the booth and try it.  And the line was like wrapped around the Expo hall.  There’s actually a building opening up in my town that has VR rooms, so I’m going to jump on that.  I also have a cousin that has the Vive, so I could always just drive over to his place and use it.  But it’s like a four hour stop and we don’t go there that often.
Interviewer: I’d also like to ask how you see the future of games, also with VR but also outside of VR. If you can make some prediction.
Respondent 6: Graphics, it’s going to keep going better which is what I’m looking forward to, because I hate crap graphics.  That’s my biggest pet peeve in games, if I’m going to buy a game I want to be able to one, actually support it so I can see the graphics.  Two, not have any lag and three, actually have a good frame rate with it.  I think that we are going to get closer to things that look like real life, I mean, with the way that graphics are in those regards.  When it comes to the actual content of video games I’m a little bit hesitant about just because everything just seems to be a sequel of another and nobody ever comes up with new and interesting ideas.  You have to sort of look at indie games for that and at the same time most indie games are just basic platformers.  
Respondent 6: I feel like when it comes to being innovative with the future of video games, Nintendo is leaps and bounds ahead of everyone, because they have so many different things incorporated and they try different things, versus everyone else that’s just strictly controller/console.  Nintendo’s the only one that really branches out and it’s like, you can take the controller off and wave them around.  If you get these little amiibo things, you can do extra stuff.  But you don’t have to get them, which is nice.  But I got them anyways.  
Interviewer: So you would see that apart from Nintendo there is more progression than innovation?  I mean, graphics get better but there is not much innovation in content and type of games?
Respondent 6: I don’t think there are actual innovations.  I feel like that’s even evidenced by XBox coming up with the XBox One apps which is the dumbest name ever, it’s worse than the XBox One.   When they came out with that they were just like, oh yeah, it’s going to be able to support games all the way back to the first generation of XBox.  So you’ve got three generations of games that you can play on it but what is that doing for innovation?  Nothing.  You are taking three steps backwards so that people can still play the same game over and over again and you don’t have to come up with anything new, different or exciting.  So I feel like there’s that.  
Respondent 6: Even though Nintendo I feel is a little more innovative with their systems, their actual games and game play are not that advanced or innovative and they’re still very basic – and I wouldn’t say rudimentary but it’s still the same old, same old, there’s nothing spectacular or new about it.  But I also feel like right now there’s only so many ways that you can actually do something.  Like I don’t see how we’re going to currently have a video game where you’ve got to move around and do all of the stuff and not have just the same old, same old.  I feel like once VR gets a little better and they actually have like stationary treadmills or whatever and you can actually move around.  I feel like we’ll eventually have little gloves that we can have on and we can actually touch things and interact that way, versus having to have a regular controller.  I feel like it will eventually get to that point but they’re not there yet obviously.
Interviewer: Moving to the last part of the interview, we talked a lot about games and potential opportunities, potential problems with games, what advice would you give to different kind of figures involved with games to make the situation better?
Respondent 6: Parents, watch what your kids are playing.  If you wouldn't play it in front of them don’t let them play it.  I feel like developers need to be a little more crazy and out there and like they really need to step out of the box.  Because everything’s just the same.  I agree that graphics are important, they’re important to me for sure, but actually have like good game play, not just the same thing over and over and over again.  I know I keep going back to Dishonoured, it’s one of the games I don’t play anymore, but the powers and that, you do different things, just like you would use this magical little jet, it’s like a grappling hook, like that awesome.  Why don’t other games have that?  
Respondent 6: It’s one of those things where, yeah, I understand that they’re trying to make it more realistic and they’re trying to increase immersion, but at the same time break immersion a little bit and make someone think rather than just get sucked into the game then just play through it mechanically.  They need to sort of – I wish there was more problem solving, I wish there was more interesting problems to sovle rather than just find the missing puzzle piece for this.  Like Zelda’s infamous for that, it’s just the same thing every single time.  I love Zelda, but for God’s sakes do something different.  I haven't played it for a while so I can't say anything about that, but it seems like, pick the little crystal thing and you open the door.  Why?  What’s the point?  That’s dumb, you’re just playing hide and go seek with a crystal.
Respondent 6: I feel like institutions, so part of the reason why at my university we convinced the honours longue to buy us a Wii was because it aids in stress relief.  I feel like there could be more of that and I feel like it’s a good way to get people together.  I think it was one of the fraternities on campus would hold a video game night in our student centre and they would invite everyone across campus to come.  I don’t know how many people actually went, I didn’t go because to me my university was more of a communal university rather than an actual place where you would get a dorm.  Like I live twenty minutes away from the university, I’m not sleeping there.  So I wouldn’t go to things past like the end of my last class at three, I would just leave and go home and beat rush hour.  
Respondent 6: So I feel like institutions could incorporate gaming and it wouldn’t be as big of a deal as they imagine it would be.  It would probably bring people closer together.  It can help with stress relief, I know I certainly play games to relieve stress, just because there’s too much stuff going on in life, got to take a break from it every so often.
Respondent 6: Educators.  This one I find a little difficult just because in class you want kids to be learning and you don’t want them distracted by the fact that it’s a video game so much.  But I feel like games can have a benefit in learning, so long as again they can't be memorised.  They would have to be randomised, you would have to be able to really think rather than just mindlessly click.  That’s part of it.
Respondent 6: Players calm down.  Stop insulting.  I feel like there’s not a lot I can suggest for players just because everybody does their own thing.  It’s their thing and I can't police them, I can't tell them, you can't do that.  I mean, it’s their choice whether they do that game or not, it’s not mine.
Interviewer: Actually I find it really curious that up until now I’ve interviewed six, seven or eight players and everyone complained about the online community.  It’s a very recurring topic.  Even with people who do play multi player games like you and enjoy it, but still there is this, I don't know, dissatisfaction with the typical interaction online.
Respondent 6: I’m getting really into the game and I’m like, hey, good luck, have fun, and then immediately I get back, kill yourself.  Come on, grow up, don’t be an idiot.  One of those things.  I’m the kind of person I try not to let them get on my nerves.  I try and do like kill with kindness, that’s just because that’s how I was raised.  I am really only that way online, in person, you see me in a car I’m not the same.  I’m an angry driver but I’m not an angry gamer.  Go figure.  But it’s just one of those things where the online community does suck, but the online community sucks for everything because people are jerks and you can't fix that.  
Respondent 6: And it only takes a couple of people that are really, really – I have to – the only word to describe them is salty.  I feel that’s something that gamers have taken and it means something more than just like, I just took a bite into this pretzel and it’s way too salty and I need a drink.  No, it’s now a way to describe someone as salty.  But it only takes a few people like that to just ruin something.  You could have a really good discussion going and someone says, that’s stupid and your dumb.  Thanks.  It only takes a few bad apples to spoil the bunch sometimes.  And I think that there does need to be a little bit harsher punishment for that.  I feel like when I report someone in League is something done right away?  No, I don’t get the notification that they’ve gone to tribunal often enough.  I’m glad that League does have a tribunal system where they do take reports into account.  But sometimes they only get a chat ban.  You know, maybe they need [an IT 1:12:00] ban for a while and they need to just step away and smell the roses and just calm down.
Respondent 6: I know that just because of who I am and what I study whenever I see people being really stressed about it, I’m just like, why don’t you get some essential oils and just keep them there.  Have a little bottle of essential oils and just smell it every so often and just calm yourself and take a sensory break.  I’m all about sensory breaks.  And I try to help people online come up with strategies to prevent them from tilting.  Or when they’re getting tilted in a game, do this and this and shake yourself up a little bit so you’re not getting there.  I feel like if games could have a section of that, like you’re getting mad at the game, you can do this to relieve that stress and do something else.  Like I have essential oils at my desk, I have a little fidget cube thing.  I do stuff whenever I can to calm myself and keep myself from yelling or getting really upset.  There’s strategies I can use to avert that and not just even get into that situation.
Interviewer: One category of people that is missing from our slide actually is therapists, what would you say to them?
Respondent 6: There’s a couple of different things that I think of when I think of therapy and games.  One of the things I think about is starting all the way at the top and looking at eSports.  Do eSports employ therapists?  If not they certainly should, they should have hand therapists.  Think about how many hours these people put into games, a lot, it’s a full-time job for them so they’re doing forty plus hours a week playing a video game.  Those poor hands and wrists.  Are they using proper body mechanics, are they actually sitting in the chair properly.  What is the level of their desk to the chair?  It’s ergonomics and they need to make sure that someone’s there to check them out and make sure that they have proper positioning.  I can't tell you how many times I’ve watched eSports, like the LCS, and I watch how these kids sit.  And I’m just like, you’re going to get carpal tunnel.  Your life is going to be ruined.  Sit better, stop—
Interviewer: You’re making me self conscious.
Respondent 6: It’s just like, stop sitting stupid. (Laughs)  That’s what I care about.  And then just in general there should be a sensory strategy for video gamers that have issues regulating their emotions.  Because through research we found that sensory regulation is just so crucial to emotional wellbeing and they’re very much intertwined.  If you ever have the opportunity to take a sensory profile do it, because it’s so interesting to see what it is that personally affects you and what changes your level of awareness and alertness and what it is that you do either subconsciously or consciously to calm yourself down when you’re in the middle of something frustrating or when you’re nervous about something.  I’m a fidgeter, I fidget with everything.  It’s part of my ADHD is I fidget a lot but it helps and it helps calm me.
Interviewer: And that’s the reason you have the cube?
Respondent 6: That’s the reason I have the cube, yes, I thank one of my co-workers for getting it for me.  But yeah, it’s one of those.  And then trickling down a little bit further with therapy actually using video games in the therapy setting as an intervention, sending a kid home with a home exercise plan that they’ll actually complete because it’s play a half hour of Weevils a day, something like that.  You take into account what the kid has at home, they’ve got an XBox, go play Viva Piñata or whatever it is, play some kid friendly game that you have, whatever in the world it is.  And even like some of the problem solving games, like the apps on your phone where you have to unblock the stupid little orange coloured brick or whatever, those are great for kids that are spatially unaware.  
Respondent 6: And that’s something, I like thinking that video games are a way to actually make kids do their therapy homework, because it’s something that motivates most kids and they’re interested in it.  And who knows, they might go above and beyond and play even more than they were supposed to.  Although their parents probably wouldn't be happy about that but I would be.  And then even using video games for kids with severe mental issues, severe cognitive deficits and even severe mental deficits, I feel that’s something that should be expanded upon.  I don’t know if in the future I will be the one to do that, maybe.  But I feel like there needs to be more research done on it and the benefits – proven benefits of it not just expected benefits, before it can be properly implemented into the field.  
Respondent 6: One thing that I think research should go into as well is – I can't remember the word – access.  Access for video games, especially for people with disabilities.  Like what if someone is paraplegic and they can only use their eyes?  Or a sip and puff, you know.  How in the world are they going to be able to play video games?  Who knows, maybe they want to and they’re not content just watching YouTube videos of someone play it, they want to experience it for themselves.  I went to the occupational therapy conference in March/April, there was a booth there that modified controllers so that people with disabilities could play video games.  And they would hook it up to a sip and puff, they would be able to modify it for amputees.  It was spectacular what they were doing.  And this is just a random group of guys that are just like, we have the skills, we could do this thing, let’s do it.  Just for fun.  
Respondent 6: I feel that’s another area of research there could be.  And just seeing how people with disabilities actually have access to video games and see if they know/can.  There’s also – do you know what the maker movement is?
Interviewer: No.
Respondent 6: That’s with 3D printing.  There was also a booth at the OT conference where there was someone from the maker movement that I spoke with, because I’m interested in 3D printing.  And he was telling me about how they have modified Smartphones and tablets for people in wheelchairs who are paraplegic that use sip and puffs.  That way they can actually use Smartphones and tablets and control then, since they’re unable to touch them.  Which I thought was very – that was nice, that was spectacular what they had going on.  So they were using 3D printers for that.  
Interviewer: We are at the end of the interview, which took just a little longer than anticipated (laughs).
Respondent 6: Sorry.
Interviewer: Oh no, thank you.  I will just ask you if there is anything you wanted to add that we didn’t touch and maybe you thought about something and didn’t know when to say it?
Respondent 6: I don’t think so, I think I got out everything that I wanted to say. Do you need any demographics or anything?
Interviewer: I forgot to ask just your age?
Respondent 6: I’m twenty-four.  
Interviewer: And you are from?
Respondent 6: I’m from Cleveland, Ohio.
Interviewer: So that’s it.  Thank you a lot for your time.  If you’re interested then we will send you the output of our research when we have analysed the interviews.  I will keep your contact and I will send it to you.

Interview 7:
Interviewer: It’s always great to meet some of, well sort of meet [anonymised]’s friends, that I see on Facebook and stuff.  So what we’ll do is this, maybe I’ll just you run the procedure and the background for the interview, just as an introduction, then we can start okay.  It should take us about, roughly about an hour, if that’s okay.
Interviewer: Well as you know, it’s part of this European research project that we’re doing called Gaming Horizons and sort of, in a nutshell basically what we’re doing is going to different groups, be they researchers, game developers, educationists, players, policy makers all sorts of different people that are somehow involved in games, and gaming and gamification.  We’re asking them to do these interviews to find out more or less what sort of views they’ve got about games, gaming and gamification, both about themselves and their experience of what they see outside, in the world outside, in society or in different areas, education or society, commerce, whatever.  
Interviewer: So yeah, and this, all these interviews then will be analysed and then we’ll sort of produce some sort of views of how different people see games and gamification and maybe then produce some sort of recommendations or some scenarios about ways that games might be taken forward in different ways.  So that’s just to give you an idea of what it’s about.  
Interviewer: As to the interview itself, basically what we’ll do is this, in the project we’ve already sort of outlined some general themes that we’re sort of investigating, talking to various people about, so we’ll sort of follow those general themes, so I’ll take you through and ask you some questions and as I come onto one of these themes I’ll put a slide, I’ll share the screen with you and you’ll see a slide just with the name of that theme, so then we’ll talk about for a bit.  Once we’ve talked about that, at the end of that part, I’ll show you another slide which is the same but just with some like, some key words associated with that theme, these are sort of things that have come already in the project, and then we’ll look at those and see if we’ve already talked about them, I’ll maybe ask you about one of them, or if you see something that you think you want to comment in those keys words you can then talk about that, okay.  
Respondent 7: Sure.  
Interviewer: So I’ll just take you through this succession of the theme and then the key works for a theme and we’ll move from one to the other and then at the end you’ll get the chance to add anything you want to add or make comments or anything.  
Respondent 7: Okay. 
Interviewer: Okay, so in terms of the interview itself, basically it’s just, it’s very informal so you don’t have to worry about sort of, making it sound like a journalistic interview or a TV interview, that’s not important because we’ll be analysing the transcript.  So basically you can take as much time as you want to think about themes.  You don’t have to respond immediately and you can correct things, change things, if you want you can also choose not to talk about something, you can say, I don’t want to speak about that, if you want to, it’s up to you, okay.  And of course you can always stop and ask me for clarification or if you’ve got any doubts about what we’re talking about, you can always stop and ask me at any point.  
Respondent 7: Okay. 
Interviewer: So let’s get the ball rolling, and I’m just putting up the first slide here, I’ll share my screen with you.  You should, I hope, see the slide, can you see it up there?
Respondent 7: Yes, I can see it. 
Interviewer: Right, we’ll start off with just a general introduction, so what I’d like you to do to start off is just say who you are, what your name is, how old you are, what you do, what your background is and what your general experience of games is, we’re talking digital games here, okay. 
Respondent 7: Okay, so I’m [anonymised], I’m twenty-one years old, I go to [anonymised] and I thought, you know, for work experience and jobs here and there, I’d work on filming events up and down the country sporadically.  
Respondent 7: My gaming history I started gaming fairly young, I think my first console that I got was PlayStation 2 maybe when I was about seven or eight years old.  Then I went onto sort of PC gaming a little bit later, played Dreamscape I think that was my first sort of MMO, like big game, because everyone in my school was playing it at the time.  And then later on I started, I got the PlayStation 3, the addition to PlayStation 2, and then ever since I’ve been a PlayStation gamer.  I’ve never got an XBox.  And then around about fifteen, sixteen years old, tied in with my interests in video and photography, I got a hard core PC, you know, that sort of thing and obviously that opened up me playing much more high graphics and intensity PC games and such, and that got me into PC gaming.  I’ve been a PC gamer since then, up until now.     
Interviewer: More or less how often would you say you played?
Respondent 7: Currently?
Interviewer: Hmm-hmm.
Respondent 7: Currently, I probably play once every two days if I can, obviously you know, it doesn’t always happen because you never know how busy you’re going to be, but it’s usually like in the evenings, about say eight o’clock ‘til about ten o’clock.  If my friends are online I can talk to this on Discord, which is a software that allows you to talk to people whilst you’re playing games and stuff.  If my friends are online sometimes we might play a big longer, or a bit shorter, we may just talk, I don’t have to play games with them because it’s always nicer to play games with friends, I just think it’s a much nicer experience. 
Interviewer: Okay, so that’s something you do on a regular basis, going to Discord and chat?
"Respondent 7: Yeah, I’d say fairly regular, like I go onto Discord most evenings, or I try to anyway; you can contact friends, whether we game or not that’s just up to whether we feel like playing a game.  Someone might say, are you up for a game of, for example, Overwatch and then everyone will be, you know, I’m not feeling it right now, but it’s nice to do that.  "
Interviewer: Okay, great.  I think that gives us a pretty good picture.  So I’ll just put up that slide with the, with those key words there and you can see-
Respondent 7: I’m just going to go landscape because I can’t see all of it.  Okay, yeah I’m there. 
Interviewer: So you’ve mentioned about your experiences and how much time and what, what sort of games would you say you play?
Respondent 7: Currently I play three sort of main games, maybe four, depending on what I’m feeling, because obviously, you know, you don’t always feel like playing one sort of game.  So I play an MMO called Guild Wars 2 and that’s a massively multiplayer online role playing game where you’re in a world with your own character, but in this world there are loads of people from all over the world pretty much and everyone’s online, so you can see everyone else and you can interact with them, and I’ve been playing that for, since 2012 actually, when it was first released, when I was playing it a lot.  Yeah, I’ve just been – like I mainly enjoyed that with friends, like up until sort of last year, but my friends stopped playing it, however I continued to play it every time a patch comes up which is roughly every two months, just because I, you know, got invested in the story and I want a continuation of that.  So that’s sort of MMO, and then sports games.  
Respondent 7: I play FIFA, which is very popular obviously, because I enjoy football in real life, I support a team, Arsenal.
Interviewer: Good, very good (laughs), that’s the correct answer [anonymised].
"Respondent 7: Ah there we go.  And then, so that’s been going a long time because obviously in 2004, I think was my first FIFA game, just because I love football and I wanted to play it.  I suppose the theory behind that is, you want to sort of be at that level with your favourite players and all of that so you want to identify with that and the easiest way to do that is system gaming.  So that’s sort of why that happened and also FIFA is a great game to play with friends because you just load it up 2x2 or whatever, you know, it’s good when you’re all together in the same room.  So that’s been going on a while; and then Overwatch is a first-person shooter which I play, probably the game that I play most currently because again with friends online it’s so easy to go in a party and group up and all go in together, and I’ve been playing that since last year when the game came out.  "
"Respondent 7: Then the fourth game is a game which is called Planet Coaster, I’ve been playing that since last year as well.  It’s basically just a theme part simulation game and I owned, probably close to Tycoon 1 and 2 back in the day and I really like theme parks, I like that sort of thing and creation games where you sort of just start off with a blank sandbox and then, you know, you just build whatever you want, whatever you’re feeling, which I think’s really fun and this game took, it took ten years for a new RollerCoaster Tycoon game to come out and when it finally did it was a money grab, so this other company who built the original RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 then went on to make their own IP game called Planet Coaster and it turned out to be way better than the official company making the new RollerCoaster Tycoon game, so I invested a bit of money into that, in early data and it turned out to be money well spent; and I drop into that every so often just to fill a little creative hole whenever I need to. "
Interviewer: Sure.  That’s interesting, so it’s interesting you mention ‘that was money well spent’, so it is something that you invest money in as well as your time and effort, and interest and so on.  
Respondent 7: Oh definitely.  I mean the thing about gaming stations, I never like to pre-order a game because, you know, there’s incentives for you to do so, you know, you might get an extra thing or get credit, you know, you never know really what the game’s going to be like until it comes out, so I’m always sceptical of, well you know, to pre-order a game.  But in this case, with Planet Coaster, like the developers showed off loads of game play and a lot of things and promised a lot of good things about it before, like well before it even came out, that you can show things like what we’re going to do in the future with it, and to help – because it was quite, you know, not the biggest company in the world, they needed a bit of money to start funding that game and – so I bought it when it was in early output.
Respondent 7: And then obviously I got an early copy of the game and everything and the community kind of grew bigger and bigger as people realised, oh wow, they’re actually doing something quite special here that developers aren’t really in this day and age, like they’re listening to feedback on the forums and building up the game through what their community are saying to them.  So you know, it was quite nice to see, and quite refreshing to see that kind of level of communication between the developers and the community playing the game. 
Interviewer: So do you think that changed your experience in some way, getting on board in the alpha stage, compared to other game experiences?
Respondent 7: I think yeah, definitely, it was – obviously something that helps fuel your interest in a game is going online and looking at other people playing that game as well, and in the case of Planet Coaster, obviously lots of, because it’s a building game you go onto YouTube and you see people creating one-percent on their YouTube channels in the game, and you look at it and think like, oh my god how can people do that, that is just, it’s insane, like the level of detail and creativity to be able to do some of the stuff, and then you go on the credit, the game has a credit page and people talking about different stuff that they like and it starts discussions and then you start getting into some of these discussions, you may even start one yourself, and then that obviously, you know, it makes you feel like, even though it’s a single player game it makes you feel like there’s more people invested in it and more people around doing what you’re doing. 
Interviewer: When you feel you’re getting an inkling, an idea of what other people are doing with it through the YouTube videos and stuff. 
Respondent 7: Yeah obviously and in that way you learn different techniques and you get inspiration and you can share inspiration with other people as well, and that definitely adds to your want to, you know, to keep playing the game I suppose. 
"Interviewer: Sure.  Well that actually, that brings us on really, really nicely to the next general theme, okay, so we’ll just move that on; which is games and the individual.  So it seems, if I understand from what you were saying, you were talking about the way you become personally very engaged in the gaming activity, both through the game play and also interacting with other games around the game, is that an accurate summation of how you see your engagement in the game building up?"
Respondent 7: Yeah, so I’m not quite sure I understand what you’re asking. 
Interviewer: Yeah just whether, I was interested in this idea that what seemed to me that you seemed to become engaged in games, like both through the game play and through the sharing, communicating with others outside of the game, sharing videos and stuff, that seems to be an important part of becoming engaged in the game. 
Respondent 7: Yeah, oh definitely, I think that an online scene and not just any online scene, a positive online scene for a game is extremely important for a game, because half the time, whatever the game is, I mean unless it’s something like FIFA and you know people are going to buy your game anyway, then it doesn’t really matter, because they’re going to sell copies.  But I think for any sort of new game, a new developer, although even sometimes big games can have bad publicity or bad, negatives online.  But in like the, I think one of the recent Call of Duty trailers came out and it had one of the biggest number of dislike views on YouTube and apparently they didn’t do very well in the sales because of it.  I think people were just getting tired of being the same, you know, recycled stuff, over and over again, that’s an example of where – it’s so extreme that backlash that the online community has, you know, been a detriment to it, to the game.  
Respondent 7: But like if you look at any game that’s doing well it will definitely have a massive online scene, it will have discussions, it will have, you know, a large amount of people looking at YouTube, videos about it, Twitch streaming is also a big thing, because if you go onto Twitch and you look at – you go to browse, it lists in order the top games being streamed at that time, like how many viewers are looking at that game.  So you generally find stuff like MOBAs at the top where they’ve got a big sort of following, in eSports, for gaming, which can also help a game become very popular, because it’s got a good competitive scene and people want to watch it.  Because you can have a very high skill cap and that leads to sort of becoming professional in that game, and therefore, you know, tournaments and stuff, and because it’s very hard to get to that stage, people want to watch that, it’s like any sport really.  
"Respondent 7: I think the biggest one is Dota 2 where they have a tournament every year called The International.  And I actually went to a bar two years ago with a couple of friends, in London, and they had this whole bar set up as a large screen to watch this, you know, a final of this gaming tournament.  And it was quite surreal, because it’s just not an environment I expected to find myself in; people gathered round a screen in a swanky bar watching essentially a game. "
Interviewer: Other people playing a game, yeah. 
Respondent 7: But like the atmosphere in there was just so encapsulating, you couldn’t help but get, you know, drawn into it and it was actually really exciting to watch in the end.  You know and obviously spending time up in London, having a few drinks with your mates, you know, that helps as well.  I’ve gone off track a little bit.
Interviewer: No, no, that’s fine.  Actually I was going to ask you about that because all of this really strong engagement of people in the games, and outside the games and so forth, and it’s, I think interesting sometimes from the outside that you get – I don’t know if you’ve heard people who voice some concerns about how much time people play, or dedicate, the different way they dedicate time and energy to digital games.  Have you ever come across those sorts of reactions?
Respondent 7: I think myself, I’ve played with a few people in Amoeba, which is like a most highly skilled cap game I think I’ve ever played, because it’s built for that, it’s built for eSports, it’s built for people coming as good as you can get, and the people that got me into that – I’ve got friends now who did take it quite seriously and they were like, you know, sort of training once a day sort of thing to try and get better at it.  But it’s like, at the end of the day that was nothing that serious in comparison to, I don’t know, I watched a documentary actually not too long ago on how professionals get to the level of being in eSport and it’s like anything in life, you want to become the best of the best, it’s like working every single day, every hour, dedicating your life, your eating pattern, your routine, just so you can be the best, like even practising finger combinations in your spare time when you’re sitting on the bus or something to try and get your muscle memory to work out the best way to go about it.  
Respondent 7: It was just so, like the documentary, I can’t remember what it was called actually, but it was so interesting to see, you know, the effect of just pixels on a screen essentially and how that just controlled peoples’ lives.  And obviously because it’s gaming you have that backlash of people who are saying it’s not a real job, or you know, like, and the way they earn money is through winning tournaments, so you’re not always guaranteed a pay cheque at the end of the day, you know so, only if you can win.  
Respondent 7: In this documentary you had, you know, like the kids, they’re about late teens into their twenties, and you had their parents sort of, you know, backlashing and saying, why’re you spending all this time on gaming when you should be at school and starting working a job, and they try and tell these parents that, you know, this is what I want to do when I grow up, this is a job essentially.  Like the amount of money potentially I could be earning is very high, like some of these tournaments go to like, you know, ten-million, tens of millions of dollars of prize money, so it can be very profitable if you can get there, it’s just, you know, it’s the sacrifices you have to make and some of those sacrifices are pretty extreme, you know, to the extent of side-lining your parents almost.  
Interviewer: Okay, yeah it’s really, really interesting because it, for me it brings up that sort of level of dedication I’m thinking comparisons with things like say basketball in the US where you’ve got this very, very, very competitive atmosphere around young people trying to make it, to become pro-basketball players and I imagine something, it sounds like something like this is true in the eSports arena as well.  
Interviewer: What about the others that aren’t going to make it though, that’s the other side of the coin isn’t it?
Respondent 7: Yeah, well in this documentary it did cover like, some people just go back to living their day to day lives because they just don’t, it’s either they can’t get to where they want to go or they just don’t enough dedication to get there, and they just end up sort of accepting that that’s the way it is, go back to, you know, it’s difficult to say ‘normal life’, you know, in comparison to what they wanted to do is, you know, this fairly normal way.  
Respondent 7: It’s a shame because, I feel like this problem will slowly disappear as time goes on because I feel like eSport’s getting bigger and bigger and that obviously makes the lower tiers more profitable as well, so even if you’re, you want to become a professional gamer, but you’re not the best, of the best, you could still sort of compete and be earning money, enough to sustain yourself.  So I feel like it’s getting bigger and I feel like in the future, say in maybe twenty-thirty years’ time it will be sort of classed as a proper sport, because more people will watch it and generations grow older, that’s just what will happen I think. 
Interviewer: So let’s just have a look, I’m just flashing up there the next slide with those key words.  You talked a lot about the immersion and engagement in those activities and you mentioned before some of the cognitive abilities that you saw developed through these, such as memory and attention, problem-solving, is that something that you have a feeling that is developed through gameplay as well?
Respondent 7: Oh yeah definitely, I think problem-solving is very important for some games in order to reach their audience.  I think the best thing to talk about is problem Guild Wars 2, the MMO that I play, because back in the day, like about a year ago, and then before then, me and my friends were playing this game and it sort of relies on, the whole way it works is, you know, you start as nothing, literally you go in a world, you’ve got like no money, no nothing and then just like a few skills, weapons and stuff, and then you sort of work your way up by doing quests and challenges and stuff, and you get slowly and slowly to the point where you’re one of the best sort of skilled capped level players in the game.  
Respondent 7: Then obviously like dungeons and brains opens up to you, and then this is where the problem-solving comes in because when you go into a dungeon you’re with four other people and you can group up with them, whoever you like, so I was with my friends and we had like a five-man dungeon and essentially these dungeons are all about working out how to, like you’ll get a series of sort of mobs, which are just enemies and bosses, which are the big, you know, end game stuff, these challenges and the way it works is, you have a dungeon leader and their, and your job, is to kind of work out the best and most efficient way to go about killing these mobs and bosses, and each sort of, they’re designed so each instance has different mechanics and different ways around killing this boss, and I think that most of the fun you get out of it is, you know, finally finding that way to beat a boss and killing it, and I think the most extreme circumstance I’ve ever been in of this is, we started about at ten, a game at night and where it was five people in there and we go through all the dungeon, it was probably one of the hardest dungeons we’ve ever done, and it got to about one o’clock.
Respondent 7: So this is three hours in and we’re finally at the final boss and it’s like a big treelike thing, it’s stomping on the ground, it has like electricity all across the floor, like how the hell are we going to do this, an hour later still not done it, and then it got to about four or five o’clock and just when you’re thinking you’re grasping it, everyone’s really tired and like, you know, it’s pretty much, we want to get to bed and – so at that stage we pretty much worked out how to do the boss, but it was so taxing that it was, you know, we just couldn’t physically pull off some of the plays, and some of the stuff requires reaction time and you know being able to sort of be in the right place at the right time, otherwise, and this is everyone, like all at the same time, otherwise it’s a wipe and everybody essentially has to restart.  So in that instance we’d had to cool it and do it all over again you know another time, but this time obviously knowing what we had to do, so we did it a lot quicker, but that was really fun at the end of it, because it was just the pure elation of finding and defeating this thing, that we’d all been working on for such a long time.  It was like that joint euphoria.
Interviewer: Yeah, I know what you mean, yeah.  It sounds, actually I was thinking while you were describing that, that one of the, as you can see, the other key words up there is collaboration and competition and it sounds like the collaboration is a very important part of that. 
Respondent 7: Oh yeah. 
Interviewer: With problem-solving and getting engaged in what you’re doing.  
"Respondent 7: Absolutely.  I think that most games rely on either collaboration or competition because I think that that’s where you get the most excitement out of games; being able to achieve a goal with your friends that’s harder at the end, you know, it taking a long time but at the end of the day it’s all, you know, you call come together to achieve that goal, that just creates that euphoria feeling like I was describing before."
Respondent 7: And the competition is, I just think that all stems from like, you know, the survival of man and getting one up, I mean obviously it was more extreme back then, but you know, these days there’s not really too much of that in life so in a virtual environment you can really amp up the pressure and pretty much put yourself in a world which you’re never, ever going to be in in real life, and especially with your friends, if you can beat them and get one over you sort of have bragging rights and, you know, for however long until you play your next game.  It’s just a really good feeling and if no one gets too sulky or angry about anything, it’s all a laugh in the end and you can all agree that it’s just a game, and why do you have to be mad.  
Interviewer: That’s really interesting you were saying, have you had the experiences where people find it harder to keep that sort of perspective that it’s just a game, do you ever see that happening?
Respondent 7: Oh yeah, when you immersed in that environment you’re pretty much relying on just your skill alone to stop, I don’t know, it’s like, hmm, it’s hard to describe.  Because sometimes you’re relying on your skill alone to win a game or sometimes there could be something that’s completely out of your control that happens and then you’re like, you know, I could’ve won that if it wasn’t for this thing, and I suppose that’s where some of the, kind of, you know, the hot-headedness comes in when you’re like, you know, I was better, but if it wasn’t for this thing, but you know, at the end of the day – the experiences with my friends is, we’ve always, even though there’s been a bit of like rage here and there, but it’s usually, we all understand that it’s just a game and we’re all just having a bit of fun.  
Respondent 7: I’ve never really been in the experience where someone’s, you know, totally just lost it and said like, you know, I’m leaving and I’m not your friend or whatever, like that’s never happened, so I’ve never been in that environment but I know it does happen because obviously all the YouTube videos online of people smashing controllers, you know, like throwing stuff at their monitors and stuff, which I can kind of understand how that happens, because you know, everyone’s different, but you know, I think we will just, or me and my friends are all just logical enough to know when enough is enough.  I hope that helps, and makes sense. 
Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  I was just wondering whether, you were talking about these people that get really, perhaps hot-headed and lose it a bit and go over the top, and then taking it out on their own screens and stuff, do you ever find that ever spills out into, onto Discord or other, the way people in an MMO interact with each other, does that sort of ever flame up?
"Respondent 7: Oh yeah, definitely, I think when you’re, when I’m online and I’m playing games you’ll see frequently people, especially in competitive games, I think that’s, where it’s the worst, is you see people just losing it, you know, saying like, oh such a bad team, or, like for example in Overwatch if you go into, just to quick play a game and you’re with five other people that you don’t know, and for example, you lose the game, you’ll see people like swearing in the chat and obviously it’s censored so it’s just stars, but you know what they’re saying pretty much.  Yeah you see people swearing, you see people saying in the group chat like, oh it’s such a bad team, like if it wasn’t for this team I would’ve won, and you definitely see people absolutely losing it; and also Overwatch has voice chat as well, so if you choose to you can hear what other people are saying.  "
Interviewer: Ah okay. 
Respondent 7: Sometimes that can be quite fun if you get people that are just, you know, they just don’t at all keep their cool and go off on one, but yeah.  I think that maybe happens when you’re playing the games. 
Interviewer: Do you know is that something that you need to watch, hearing other peoples’ live comments and stuff on chat while they’re playing?
Respondent 7: Is it something I what sorry?
Interviewer: It that unique to that game, Overwatch, where you can actually hear peoples’ reactions as they’re playing?
Respondent 7: Oh no, I mean most, a lot of, not all of them, but most competitive online games on PC will have an option for voice chat and text chat.  For example, a collaboration game, Guild Wars, it doesn’t have voice chat because for obvious reasons, like you’ll have a thousand people speaking in one area and you just wouldn’t be able to hear anyone, but it has text chat and it’s actually a good example of a map game of people using text chat for good because it’s like, because there’s no competition, because everyone’s sort of going towards the same goal, you’re always seeing sort of nicer stuff in the chat, and actually Guilds is a good example of one of the best games I’ve played for that, because it’s, you know, there’s no reason to get enraged or anything, because nothing ever happens to make you raged.  You may, you know, you can still like die or that sort of thing, but it’s always your own fault, like it’s never someone else’s, so there’s no reason to get raged at the chat.  But yeah.
Interviewer: Okay, good, one last area there is physical activity, how do you see the impact of games on physical activity?
Respondent 7: It’s an interesting one, yeah I’ll be a bit honest here, in my teenage years I probably did less physical activity, like outside because I was gaming a bit too much.  I’ve always been very sporty all my life and when I was about thirteen I did get a, I fractured my wrist, like just below the wrist and that put me out of action of sports for quite a while, and even to this day I can’t really play like really heavy wrist activities like tennis and stuff.  But like, so that had a bit of an impact on why I didn’t do quite as much sport in my teenage years, but I feel like, yeah I didn’t do quite as much just because I could be indoors and on my computer.  
Respondent 7: But then, you know, it’s difficult to say, you know, because I still feel like I did a lot, like I was playing football like three times a week and that sort of thing, and I’m not really the most extreme person when it comes to, you know, just leaving the outside world for games, because at the end of the day gaming for me is always a secondary activity, if I could be doing something else more productive, I would be.  So there’s that, and in recent years actually I’ve definitely sort of, you know, come to that conclusion that it is, you know, gaming is an enjoyment, it is a pastime, but it’s not like, you know, something my life revolves around at all. 
Interviewer: Sure.  
"Respondent 7: And since like last year I’ve been running more, so I definitely get enough exercise.  When it comes to other people I haven’t run into too many experiences where gaming has sort of totally overtaken their lives.  But I know it definitely happens, because you see online all the time, like people with, for example, in Guild Wars where, it’s a game based on how much sort of time you spend in the game, you know, how much gear you have and that sort of stuff, and you see people online with like thousands of gold and like the best item in the game and you’re like, obviously you must’ve been spending a hell of a lot of time in games to get to that stage, and obviously different games have different ways of telling when people have played a lot.  And you’re like, you’re kind of sometimes curious, so you work it out and you go onto your calculator and you’re like, okay to get this, how much time must have they spent, and you look and it’s like, how, seven hours a day, how the hell, you know, like how the hell can you spend seven hours a day playing a game, it must hurt; you know, I suppose some do.  So yeah, that’s very much my experience. "
Interviewer: It was interesting you mentioned there about your running, because running, jogging and so forth, that seems to be one of those areas where games has sort of been coming into that physical activity and using games and gamification to get people running as well. 
Respondent 7: Yeah, I’ve never crossed to myself, but – are you talking like Wii sports and that sort of thing, or?
Interviewer: Well there’s that level, yes of Wii sports and stuff, and there’s also, I’m thinking like gaps, some sort of running apps and things are linked with watches and stuff, that they’ve actually gamified the process to try and make it into a game. 
Respondent 7: Okay, yes, so I wasn’t quite sure what level you were speaking there, but yeah.  I do actually own an Apple Watch now, and that’s because of my running.  Like when I started a year ago I was, I had my phone on my arm, and I was sort of tracking my stats through there, and also listening to music on the go, but with the massive phone on my arm it just wasn’t comfortable and I was always finding when I was running round that I was having like irritations or it slipping and stuff like that, and I just couldn’t concentrate on what I wanted to do, was run, and sort of the aim to get better and better.
Respondent 7: so I bought the Apple Watch because it had all the fitness functionality that I wanted and it also had the links to the iPhone and that side of social stuff as well, so for me it was the perfect purchase, I’m not saying for everyone it is, because you know, not everyone, not everyone’s lifestyle suits it, but for me it’s been great, because it’s literally, I can leave my phone at home, I can put it on my wrist, I can wirelessly play music through it, to my ears and it tracks your timing, your heart rate and everything, it gives you live updates as you go round, so I’ve definitely noticed an improvement and my pace, and for about a month I must’ve improved my pacing by about a minute per mile, so – and I honestly believe it was down to the Apple Watch because you’re always thinking about your time and you’re always thinking about how fast you’re going, and just apps and stuff like that have definitely improved my experience of exercise outside. 
Interviewer: Have you ever been tempted to try out one of those ones that actually make it into a game, like a gamified version?
Respondent 7: I have actually, one of Miriam’s friends, Annie, told me about this, oh no, it must’ve – I think it was Howard actually told me about this one which is, like it puts you in the environment of, like an apocalyptic world and it kind of has sound effects and a narrative whereby you’re being chased by zombies and it’s like, obviously you know, there’s nothing behind you but if you’re listening to all of that and – because when you’re running you’re always looking forward anyway, so you don’t look what’s behind you.  I kind of, I’m interested in finding out what that would be like, just to kind of, put yourself in that environment where zombies are chasing you and like the narratives telling you, they’re getting faster, so you’ve got to run faster and, that’d be quite fun actually.  I’d be interested in trying something like that.  
Interviewer: Well that actually brings us on nicely to the next theme, I’ll just put up the next thing, which is different applications of games, so in this case you might say that an app like that is an application of gamification to gamify the activity of jogging, to get people more active and so forth.  Have you ever played any sort of gamified activities, or games themselves where you think, or you had the idea, or the impression, or the goal that it was something as well and in addition to the entertainment of games that had actually some sort of specific application?
Respondent 7: So are you talking about games that sort of, that are linked to your phones by having like an app on your phone that adds your game experience?
Interviewer: No, in this case application is more – sorry, I’m just getting a call through here.  Sorry about that.  No in this case as in games applied to a feel, like we’re saying apply to jogging, or running, or exercise, or apply to learning or apply to training, these sort of things.  Have you ever had any experience with those sorts of games, applied to different things?
Respondent 7: Let me think, I’m trying to figure out if I have.  
Interviewer: Sometimes say like in school, or in university or professional training, these sorts of things, games are used.
Respondent 7: Yeah, well other than a pastime like when you just, like on the Tube or whatever and you’ve got a basic like, tap to jump sort of game just to pass the time, I can’t really think myself that I’ve used a game for any sort of outdoor, or to enhance the outdoor experience, and I probably have just forgotten to be honest. 
Interviewer: And you’ve never, like when you were at school or at uni, that none of your lecturers or teachers or anyone never used games for learning to teach different subjects or things?
Respondent 7: I think at school, yeah it happened, you know a bit, maybe – definitely my younger days, like at prep school we had games to help teach us languages and games to help teach us – I think IT was the biggest one, because IT can be quite taxing in terms of understanding how coding works, it can be quite boring.  So stuff like you’ll have a robot on screen app and your job is to get the robot to move by putting in codes you get the robot to move and that’s, I suppose, a way in which gaming has made learning a bit more fun.  
Respondent 7: There was also, I distinctively remember in the past, a game called, actually no, I can’t remember what it was called, but it was all about this sort of fox who was, he was a French fox and it was, you were following this fox through its story, throughout France and it was teaching you different things about the French language, I remember completing it actually, so it can’t have been that bad.  Ah yeah, although I can’t really remember it, it definitely was the narrative that pulled you through and helped you learn and made it more interesting to learn French phrases and the language.  
Respondent 7: Yeah, at sort of high school it happened a bit, I think with maths, obviously maths is quite a good one because you can just say, oh you’ve got a scenario here, you know on the screen and I think they used like apples and oranges, just statistics, how many apples and oranges do each person get like, I don’t know, it’s a scenario where you sort of divide up apples and oranges, but sure, you know, and that was in game or something and it helps learning, but I suppose in high school you don’t really need that quite as much because you’re always committed into learning, you know, whatever, every, you need that level of engagement it just makes it a little bit more, and easier to digest.  
Interviewer: Okay.  So you see it almost like a sort of sugar on the pill sort of thing, that just makes the flavour of it a little bit more interesting. 
Respondent 7: Yeah, absolutely, and I think that’s definitely the best way to describe it.  
Respondent 7: At university I don’t think it’s really happened, because film and TV is quite visual itself, so you don’t really need anything else.  It’s all in the experience itself, and I suppose when you get to university anyway you’re doing what you love, so you’re just invested in learning that as much as you can, because you love what you’re studying.  
Interviewer: Right, so the motivation’s—
Respondent 7: You don’t need anything else to enhance that experience. 
Interviewer: Okay, that’s very interesting.  Okay, well I’m just putting up the next slide here with some of the key words about applications of games and you mentioned there things like school and learning, serious games, the sport you mentioned earlier.  There’s also gamification, have you had any experience with that?
Respondent 7: I feel like I’ve heard the word before, but could you remind what it means?
Interviewer: Well it’s actually different people see it in very different ways, but I guess the most, I suppose the standard definition is when you get game mechanics that are typical of games where they’re applied to things outside of games to try to engage people in activities.  So it might be things like the running one we were talking before, so if you’ve got things like leader boards and points and rewards, and badges, these sorts of things, where they’re applied to an activity that isn’t of itself a game.  
Respondent 7: Right.  Hmm, well I suppose the running app that I have now is, it’s the My Running app, so it’s not really technically on the game level, but what it has is this little section of achievements and stuff, and kind of leader boards, oh actually, I’ll come onto leader boards in a second, but it’s effectively, like little medals you gain, like how long you’ve run and like your fastest times and stuff like that, and actually that can be quite useful in terms of, okay, that’s my fastest minute per mile, I’m going to try next time to get better than that, and I suppose in that way you’re internally beating yourself, to try and get better and better and in that way I suppose you could almost say like you’re playing a game with yourself. 
Respondent 7: In terms of the competition, which I just thought of, which is quite interesting, it actually, every single Sunday it has a thing called Just Do It Sunday, where if you run you get put onto a leader board, you have to run five kilometres to qualify, but it puts you onto a leader board with everybody that’s run that five kilometres on that Sunday, and you can compare yourself throughout, how many people in the world have done this and see where you come essentially like in the world.  
Respondent 7: So it’s almost like a virtual race you’re having, and obviously there’s no one around you when you run, but virtually when you get back and link it all to your phone you can see that, you know, you’ve essentially run with 200,000 people the same distance, on the same leader board, just on a different route, and that can be quite cool to see.  And that definitely has actually got me running on Sundays, because it’s nice to compare yourself to the world, and like every Sunday if you’ve gone up a couple of thousand places or whatever, that could be quite good to see as well.  
Respondent 7: I suppose some people in like the top ten, they could get very competitive, so you know, that could definitely be something that I would say is gamification on a loose level. 
Interviewer: Yeah, definitely, okay.  Good, that’s really interesting.  Earning with games, I think we’ve mentioned, you’ve covered that quite a lot in talking about the eSports and people who now actually make a living out of playing the game apart from just, as well as making them and commercialising.  
Interviewer: Okay, so I think we can move on now to the next theme, general theme, which is ethical issues.  Have you had any sort of experiences or thoughts, or heard of people discussing different sorts of ethical issues connected with games and gaming?
Respondent 7: Yeah definitely, I think quite an interesting thing to think about when it comes to this topic is if you look at a lot of eighteen rates games, and obviously they’re eighteen rated for a reason, they’ve got drugs and alcohol abuse, and this sort of stuff and, you know, if you’re eighteen and over it’s your choice to make whether you want to expose yourself to this sort of material.  But ironically it’s these sort of games you find the youngest community on, and like Call of Duty, which is an eighteen rated game, has sort of this online unwritten sort of stigma around it for being heavily populated with like twelve to thirteen year olds, they’re called Squeakers because squeakers because, you know, their voices haven’t broken yet, yeah you can hear them online screaming all the time.  
Respondent 7: It does make a thing because they can’t have just gone into a shop and bought these games themselves, you know, I suppose when you buy them online you don’t really need identification of your age, so they could just have bought them online or downloaded them online.  So you know, it could be that, but also quite a lot of them will have their parents buying the games for them as well, which is obviously, I would say that it’s probably down to their parents whether they think their child is mature enough, but at twelve or thirteen, I think that might be a little bit too extreme to be playing a game that’s rated eighteen, for those reasons.  
Respondent 7: You know, and, it’s like – you know, I mean I can’t really talk for myself I played my first Call of Duty at fourteen and that wasn’t through my parents buying it, that was because I was round someone else’s house and they had the game, and to be honest in, I couldn’t really see too much wrong with it, and whether you can say that it makes, it influences more people, like younger people to, like exposing them all to guns and that sort of thing, it’s hard to say, because there’s no real proof that those two things are linked.  
Respondent 7: I actually studied this sort of thing back in GCSE, in media studies, where more panics are surrounded by games and how like events in real life are kind of sometimes put on games.  Like for example, the Columbine shooting back in the day, I think the papers sort of blamed the fact that the teenagers who instigated the shooting played a shooter game on their computers, and because that was the easiest thing at the time to blame, like all the media and stuff focused it on that rather than something like, oh their parents didn’t bring them up well, or the exposure, or how easy they could access guns at their age.  Because I don’t know, it’s almost like the media loves to blame what’s easy to blame, because they know that they’re going to get no backlash from it.
Respondent 7: Because I mean if you look at it this way, at the end of the day, who’s going to end up buying the papers and watching the news, it’s going to be the parents of these children and it’s so much easier to blame stuff like video games and, I can’t even remember what else, but you know there’s lots of easy things just to, to blame and all the major stuff is swept under the rug, for example like, gun laws in the US, why’s that never blamed?  Because if no one had access to guns, these things just wouldn’t happen, or if their parents had been more attentive in their lives and told them what’s right and wrong, again you could argue that these things would never happen.  
Respondent 7: So although, you know, a lot of games involve killing and guns, and violence and this sort of stuff, I think that’s more down to putting people in a world which then they can’t be exposed to in real life.  It’s, I think it’s like what Richard Dyer said, is sort of, his theory about how it creates a, gaming creates a utopian world from real life, so you immerse yourself in a world which you’re never, ever, going to find yourself in, or it’s extremely unlikely.  
Interviewer: So it’s a fantasy, definitely a fantasy of emitting that sense. 
Respondent 7: Yeah, definitely.  For example like, I mean that’s probably the main reason I play FIFA, is because I enjoy football, well like playing football but I’m never going to play at the top level of football, because I know how hard it is to get there and how much that takes.  And obviously at my age like I’m never going to, you know, now get there because you have to start at a really young age, that sort of thing.  But obviously that feels, that whole, it’s essentially bridging the gap between reality and what you deem to be out of reach.  
Interviewer: It’s interesting what you’re saying about bridging, this idea of bridging reality between, bridging between reality and the virtual idea.  Also the same happens isn’t it with identities in the sense you were talking like before with the different MMOs and that people assuming different identities, playing out and playing with different identities.  
Respondent 7: Yeah, I will say the thing about MMOs it’s incredibly easy to spread your own identity because the character customisation is, allows you to do that.  For example, you can play any of the five races, all of which have both genders and from there, you know, you can get your character to look pretty much exactly how you want.  So there are about ways to make the character look how you want to look and then how you customise that character with armour and dyes and colours and that sort of thing, and you can change them pretty much whenever you like.  
Respondent 7: So pretty much you have a scenario where everyone’s in this fantasy world which they’re then going to experience, set in a, a storyline, sort of – just kind of, you know, sort of, I’m trying to find the word, a storyline that’s been encapsulated by a certain law that’s been created by the game developers.  And you’ve got a scenario where’s there’s hundreds of thousands of people who all could run into one another at any point, but every single one of those is going to look different.  So I think that that’s kind of what you asked me, and the ways people can diversify themselves to do it. 
Interviewer: Does that, do you think, raise any ethical issues?  Because it opens up so many different possibilities doesn’t it of behaving and reacting with people in different ways?  Do you think it has ethical implications?
Respondent 7: I mean I think in some games it can, Guild Wars isn’t a great example because I suppose the controlled thing about it is you can never look too kind of extreme, like I don’t know, for example, like in a – because I mean the age rating it can’t allow you to do something that’s untowards.  But I suppose in something like Call of Duty, you can customise like emblems and stuff, so you can pretty much have anything you want to on your profile or any picture you kind of wanted, so whatever comes up, you know the horrible things that you can put on your profile that pretty much anyone can see because like I said, twelve year olds and thirteen year olds play that game as well.  
Respondent 7: So yeah, like I don’t think there’s anything wrong with expressing yourself in the way that you want in gaming, just, you know, it depends on what the game developers allow you to do I suppose.  Because at the end of the day it’s all controlled through there, and it’s the game developers’ responsibility to make a game that’s appropriate for its community and its target market.  
Interviewer: Okay, good.  So on that point we’ll just bring up the next slide which has got the, some of key words that have come up related to ethical issues.  So things like identity and diversity you mentioned there about taking on different genders and races and things, and you mentioned the thing with violence and aggression and so forth.  What about monetisation, do you think there are ethical implications on monetisation?
Respondent 7: I don’t think so, because at the end of the day if a game developer decides that they want to charge for a certain thing in a game, or there’s an app that has add-ons which you pay for, at the end of the day it’s the consumers’ sort of choice whether they want to pay that or not, and I just think it’s just a way of making more money and I think that it becomes the stage where it’s unfair that the developer is making you pay for exclusive content in a game, if people deem that unfair they’re just going to lose popularity and more people will stop playing that game.  So I don’t think that there’s anything wrong with it, although like I said, it’s on the bit where the game developers themselves to control what is appropriate, like what’s an appropriate level of monetisation.  
Interviewer: Yes, because there’s also the reverse side of that medallion if you like, is the piracy issue as well. 
Respondent 7: Oh yes, of course. 
Interviewer: Which I guess is considered an ethical issue. 
Respondent 7: So I think that’s getting better and better because every single person I know who plays games doesn’t pirate games and I’ve never pirated a game myself, because I think that games are so easily accessible to us through, just like for example, I’ve got my computer in front of me here and I’ve got two apps open, just to sort of help myself remember some things.  One’s called Steam, which you’ve probably heard it and it’s a store which has thousands and thousands of games on it, some of them free, some of them you pay for.  
Respondent 7: But if I wanted to play any game I could think of, I could literally go on here and have a look at what sort of games are in that category and they’re usually pretty reasonably priced.  And I think that the piracy side of things only comes to it when a game is quite clearly overpriced for what it is, and loads of people want to play it, which is never really the case because if someone creates a game that everyone wants to play then they can charge a higher amount and people pay it.  
Respondent 7: And then if someone creates a really cool game that hasn’t had a lot airtime and investment into it and it’s charged a lot, people just won’t buy it and they won’t want to play it either because there’s just no point.  So [it’s not pirated either 1:06:34] and – but yeah.  I think in the past it was a problem, but it’s not a problem now.  It’s not like the film industry, I think the film industry’s much worse than the gaming industry right now with regards to piracy, because I don’t think it’s quite as easily accessible, like if you want to watch a film it’s not quite as easily accessible to purchase something, or, because mainly because it’s so easy just to go onto sites like 123movies, just type in a movie and it’s there, like you can watch it just, you know, it happens. 
Interviewer: On the spot, yeah. 
Respondent 7: It’s literally, it will take you a second to find it and watch it, so in terms of that it’s bad for the industry but in order for the industry to compete they need to make it easy for people to watch their content.  Because DVDs are still a thing, because people like to have these copies.  But they are dying out and I don’t really know, do people go out and buy DVDs, because, well especially in this country, streaming is such a big thing these days that I don’t think I’ve bought a DVD for years now to be honest.  
Respondent 7: And actually that’s the same with games as well, I can’t really remember, I think the only thing I’ve bought in a box is Deeper, because I like have the Deepers in a line on a shelf, but it’s just something that I did, but like any game I have these days I’ll download it online.  Again because it’s so much easier and hard drive space is becoming more and more and more, internet speeds are also a big contributor to that.  You know, like it’s so fast like I have a game which is about thirty-five gigabytes, which back in, a couple of years ago, would’ve taken you may be like two or three hours to download, now it takes you fifteen minutes, so it’s not even, like a massive game and it’s so easy to just get and access without getting a physical copy. 
Interviewer: Right, so those things you seem to be tracing a picture where things have changed and are changing quite rapidly, and actually that could bring us on quite well to the next general them, which is games in society, okay.  So now we’re perhaps thinking in terms, sort in more general terms about whether, or how, or whether you see games, gaming as an activity, or the games themselves, gamification, as having an influence in one way or another on society, whether they be social influence, or cultural influence or those sorts of things, innovations and so forth. 
Respondent 7: Yeah, I think the best thing to talk about in regard to that is probably virtual reality, I think virtual reality, unlike 3D, is not just a gimmick because it’s so useful for so many things.  And in the past few years virtual reality has taken off massively, and you see all the major, like gaming corporations like Sony and Microsoft, heavily investing into it, because it is something that I think in the future, people will start to see much more of.  
Respondent 7: Like, not just in the gaming sense, where you put the headset on and you immerse yourself in the environment, like you’re actually there, which is quite big.  I’ve never tried it myself, but it’s definitely one of those things which I want to try because it’s really cool.  But just the stuff like, you know, I think it’s people like art designers who can put the headset on and they’re able to do their art, or design their buildings, or you know, create their virtual worlds in this 3D space and it’s like they’re in their living room, but in their living room they might have like the Empire State Building just sitting there in the room, like reach out and almost stroke it.  
Respondent 7: You know, like the buildings and stuff, and for art, it’s something which can save time massively on the sort of designing process.  So in terms of that I think through gaming and the want for people to be literally in those worlds themselves, you know, and blank themselves off from reality, so yeah, so through that and through virtual reality sort of building through that, it’s also spread into other areas in real life, in peoples’ professions and making things easier for people.  
Interviewer: Yeah, it’s interesting you saying, you’ve mentioned art as a possible avenue that that might take, so you see the applications of games and virtual reality in art as being a future direction perhaps?
Respondent 7: Oh yeah definitely, because I can’t, I don’t mean, I’ve never done it myself, but I’ve seen videos of people who put the virtual reality headset on and they’ve got like a virtual paintbrush in their hand and they can literally see it, like when they stick their arm out, they see their arm out with a paintbrush on the end.  And they’re like going round this 3D space and painting pictures and like colourful lines or whatever and they can literally, when they’re walking round it, they’re walking around a 3D thing that they’ve just put there, you know, in their room and they can still see their room.  But in the middle of the room there’s this thing they’ve just created, that’s something that was never before possible without virtual reality and applications, allowing them to do this.  
Interviewer: Okay, I’ll just put up some of those key words that have come up related to games in society, so you’ve mentioned art and games there, and some, perhaps innovations in games like virtual reality and entered reality and things, are there any sort of general cultural changes that you have seen or think will come about through games?
Respondent 7: Yeah, I think there’s been a slight shift in the way people spend time over, like just pastime over the last ten years, I think.  Because for example for mum, and my dad, they’re not gamers at all, so the way I’ve ended up playing games has been through online communities and friends telling me about stuff, that’s pretty much what got me into it.  And the way my parents spend their time is, like in the evening they’ll be watching TV or whatever and, you know, sometimes they say to me, well especially in my teenage days, when I was playing maybe a little bit too much, they’d say like, should you be playing quite so much, you know, games and stuff.  
Respondent 7: But then I’d throw back the argument to them, well in the evenings what’re you doing, you’re just watching TV, this is just my way of spending my free time, which you know, is fair enough.  And although that, like I probably was – they were right, they were definitely right.  But like at the end of the day I think it’s just a shift in how people are spending their free time.  If you look, like in the streets or on the Tube, you’ll see people on their phones, like playing these little touch games and stuff, spending time, whereas before they might’ve been listening to music, or perhaps they’re listening to music and playing games at the same time.  
Respondent 7: I think that’s definitely, although because of social media and the way that’s taken off in the last ten years as well, that’s had an influence in the way people socialise in real life as well.  Like when you go into a pub or something you’ll see way more people on phones these days rather than a couple of years ago for example.  Which again, it’s a shame to see it because, you know, when I go into a pub with people, I like to put my phone away and sit down and have a good conversation rather than, you know, start tapping away or swiping away, or whatever.  Because I feel like that’s kind of the break from it, this world, when maybe ten years ago the gaming and the social online activity was the break from real life.  Whereas these days sometimes people treat talking to actual people as a break from their online life as it were. 
Interviewer: I see what you mean, yeah. 
Respondent 7: Definitely for some people it’s been a shift in how long they spend on online gaming rather than real experiences.  
Interviewer: Sure.  
Respondent 7: And how much they go out for example.  I mean through gaming and such, and being, or staying with my London friends online, that’s definitely, probably made me stay in more in the evenings than I usually would.  Because I could either go out sometimes, or I could go, you know what, I’m feeling quite chilled, I’m just going to stay in, go on Discord, talk to my friends, whether we go, whether we play games or not, it doesn’t really matter to me, but by definitely having that online community has made me, I suppose it’s not being bored when you stay in sometimes, it breaks it up. 
Interviewer: Yeah I understand perfectly what you mean, so it’s, let’s say, perhaps if I understand you rightly, it’s a sort of reframing the idea of what it is to socialise around an activity, a leisure activity, whereas it’s a bit different with games from others, like comparing them to how that compares to say going out to the pub or watching a film or whatever.  Yeah, it’s interesting.  
"Interviewer: Okay, at this point I think, [anonymised], we can move onto the very last part, we’ve sort of covered the main themes.  We’re asking everyone we’ve interviewed if they have any particular suggestions, I think if you’re talking about the different sorts of people that are involved in games, and gaming and gamification, be they developers, it might be parents, players, policy makers, researcher, teachers, whatever; if there any specific suggestions you would make based on your experience and your ideas, your views, that you would give to them to sort of take games and gaming forward?"
Respondent 7: Wow that’s quite a tough one.   So you’re sort of asking me, like what suggestions I would give to anyone?
"Interviewer: Yeah, anyone, if you had say a group of game developers, or a group of researchers, or a group of educators or policy makers, if you could say, look you know, I’ve seen sort of these things happen and I would think that a good way to improve things might be to do this; if there’s anything that comes to mind, it doesn’t have to be anything specific that comes to mind. "
Respondent 7: I mean the one thing that’s just struck me is with regards to monetisation, I think just to talk about the, what I think is the best way to go about it, and the way I’ve seen people respond the best way and the most successful way to monetisation is create a game that relies solely upon your own skill and what you can put into the game itself in order to progress.  However, if you want to monetise a game, make it so it doesn’t affect anyone’s skill, so essentially pay to win, because that makes it unfair for other people, because if you do that it ends up becoming okay so, the person who has paid the most money into this game is the best player.
Respondent 7: Whereas I think that the best way to do is, introduce monetisation methods where it just, you know, sort of improves peoples’ cosmetics and what they look like, or what they have, or where they can go, that sort of thing.  So no one is influenced or given an unfair advantage by just paying more into the game.  And obviously the game Guild Wars 2 which I’ve talked about has that in place right now, and I think it’s the best implementation of monetisation that I’ve ever seen in any game.  So that’s something that just came to me, off the top of my head. 
Interviewer: Okay, good.  I’ll just put the last slide here, these were some of those different groups, stakeholder groups that I mentioned before.  You can see the institutions as well that are involved, or should, or could be more involved with games and gaming, game playing. 
Respondent 7: Yeah, I think like in regards with institutions and educators, I think games are a really good way of easing a different target market into whatever you’re trying to achieve maybe, because obviously, you know, associated with younger people a lot more, but there are quite a lot of older people who still do play games, and I think like in MMOs and stuff, you have that sort of older community.  But I just, I think because some people are stubborn to embrace gaming because they see it as kind of, a sort of a bad/good in a way, something that creates a lot of money but also has a lot of negative impacts on life in general.  But I think it’s more people embrace gaming as something that can not only be used for free time enjoyment but also for industry productivity and a way of motivating more people into just taking an interest in whatever it may be.  I think perhaps that might be a good way to get more people invested.  
Interviewer: Okay, so working on somehow, or working on the image of games and gaming and the marketing by the sounds of it as well. 
Respondent 7: Yeah, definitely.  I mean like I said I think gaming, it’s one of the biggest industries in the world right now and definitely online marketing, such as, you know, like YouTube and Twitch and all this sort of stuff, I think gaming’s actually the most popular category on YouTube right now.  So yeah, I think that it is definitely getting better, but yeah just, like the way people look at it and be, just accepting gaming.  Obviously it doesn’t suit all purposes, but maybe if more people thought about it you would definitely see more engagement from people at all different level of, you know, whatever it may be.  
Interviewer: Good, okay great.  That’s really good.  Thanks for those thoughts.  And just to wrap it up as it were, we’d like to give you the opportunity if you’ve got any questions or any comments, either about what we’ve talked about or other things you want to mention that have come to mind, or if you’ve got any comments or thoughts about the interview itself.  
Respondent 7: Yeah, it’s really interesting to talk about this, on this level.  Because I’ve never really done something like this before and it’s amazing just through the experiences I’ve had, I don’t call myself a hard-core gamer or I don’t sort of, like I said, I see gaming as sort of like a second, side-line thing to pass the time, for me personally.  But it’s really nice to see how much discussion it creates, just from playing games, because it also exposes you to, like I said, the online the community and this interview in general has definitely made me think about sort of, you know, ethical and social implications of playing games, and what that could mean in the future.  So yeah, I’d just like to say thank you and I’ve really enjoyed it. 
Interviewer: Okay, oh great, I’m really, really glad that you have.  Because it’s been really interesting for me as well, and it’s been really interesting to see some of your, get an idea of your views and the insight you have on it.  It’s also a little bit frustrating for me in this role as an interviewer, because whereas I would like to sort of stop and really talk about stuff that comes up that you mention, that really interests me and I’d like to learn more about and get a better understanding of, I can’t do that because there’s a certain limitation obviously.  So that’s the sort of downside for me.  
Interviewer: It’s been a really, really good interview [anonymised], and I thank you a lot for them, because we’ve got so much really good stuff there. 

Interview 8:
"Interviewer: As you know we’re doing this research project about games, gaming and gamification.  So basically what we’re doing is we’re interviewing groups of people, be they players, researchers, educators, policy makers, whatever; one of the activities anyway, interviewing them to get their different sort of views and perspectives on their own activities about games and gaming, and gamification, but also about the situation more generally, let’s say in the community, in society in general, just to try and get sort of the different perspectives and different ideas about gaming so we can perhaps fashion some different paths or scenarios or something for taking things forward.  "
Interviewer: So yeah, so we’re doing these interviews which are recorded, they’re going to be transcribed and then they’re going to be analysed.  They’re going to be made anonymous, so they will be available online through the website, no one will ever go to them, but they have to be there for contractual purposes, for the European Commission, but they’re made anonymous, so that’s okay.  
Interviewer: Yeah, so what we’ll do, we’ll work it this way basically.  What we’ve done in the project, we’ve sort of outlined some general themes that we’re investigating, okay.  So what I’ll do I’ve got some slides, so I’ll just show you a slide of that general theme and I’ll ask you some things and we’ll talk about things related to that theme.  
Interviewer: Then at a certain point I’ll show you a second slide which will have some like key words on it and these are different sort of key words, ideas that have come up during the project around that topic, so we can look at those together and sort of see if we’ve already discussed them and if they bring to mind other things that we want to talk about, or that you would like to add and stuff, we can do that.  So I’ll just sort of present those to you as we go through the interview.  
Respondent 8: Yeah, that sounds good.  
"Interviewer: And as far as the interview itself goes, it’s just relaxed in the sense that, I mean it’s not a journalistic interview, so you don’t have to perform or anything, so you can just take as much time as you like, you can change your mind, you can add things, strike things as you like, you can stop me to ask me stuff whenever you like, if you need clarification or you have doubts or anything.  You can actually not respond to anything that I ask you to, that’s fine, okay; and at the end when we’ve done, at the end I’ll give you some space so you can ask me some stuff, or make some comments about what we’ve talked about, or about the interview.  "
Interviewer: Right, we can now get down to it, so I’ll just put up the screen share and you should be able to see at this point the first slide.  Can you see it there?
Respondent 8: Yes, I can see it now.  
Interviewer: Great.  So [anonymised], what I’ll get you to do to start off, if you can just say your name, who you are, what you do, a bit about your background, your age and a bit about your game playing experience and habits and so forth. 
Respondent 8: Okay, sure.  My name’s [anonymised], I’m a twenty year old Northern Irish student living in Cambridge UK.  I was born in Northern Ireland and I’m currently studying film and TV production at Cambridge.  I’m working as a gymnastics instructor and yeah, I’m just about to go into my third year of uni now.  
"Respondent 8: I’ve been playing video games since I was very young, I remember the first game I had was a, like a Pokémon Yellow on Game Boy Colour, I played Game Boy games, Nintendo, throughout my whole life.  I played games when I was in the car, when I was being driven or anything, like anytime I was waiting I was always playing a game, and as I got older I started playing a few more console games, I had a PlayStation 2 and that was my main like, when I was at home that’s when I was playing, and when I was out and about I was playing my Game Boy and DS, and I stopped playing DS after a while and just focused more on, like my PlayStation 2; like I’ve got a massive collection, I still play those games now.  "
Respondent 8: I had a PlayStation 3 that I shared with my brother, I did enjoy them and there’s a lot of things about new-age games that I enjoy but there’s a lot of, there’s all things about when games were more simple I think, I prefer the storytelling tools that they used, like not necessarily say, they’re good graphics or bad, but I think that’s definitely my style of video games.  
Interviewer: Right, okay, good.  So more or less, just approximating how often would you say, or how much do you play?
Respondent 8: I’d probably say I spent about four or five hours a week right now, just because in uni I’ve been a little bit busier than, definitely when I was younger, coming into summer and I’m about to head home where I’ll have my PlayStation 2, my PlayStation 3 and I’ll be working for two months, so, like when I went home for Easter I play a lot more.  I’ve been playing a lot more Steam games as well, just because I always have my laptop on me, and I’m always doing other work and stuff on it.  Like I play a lot more games on there.  
Respondent 8: I was never really into online games, but I want to start doing that a bit more, so right now I’m limited, but yeah I’ve started playing a lot more like online and I’ve been thinking about buying a PS4 for that purpose of playing next gen stuff online with my friends.  So I don’t know how that’s going to change, but right now it’s a lot of playing my DS, play small like games on a PS2, but yeah. 
Interviewer: And what, if you could sort of classify it or define it, what sort of games would you say you played mostly?
Respondent 8: FIFA, RPGs, a lot of RPGs, I’ve always liked puzzle games and only in the last maybe five or six years started playing some more, like FPS games.  I was never really interested in that, though I played a few puzzle solving, like shooter games, but I only recently started like trying like CS-Go and the Call of Duty stuff.  So action adventure definitely, but I would, the game I would always come back to would be a really well-crafted, like RPG, really immersive sort of games.  
Interviewer: You call them immersive games, what would you say makes those games immersive?
Respondent 8: Well some of my favourite games like, there’s a game called Ultimate Spiderman on PS2 and by today’s graphics it isn’t brilliant, but it was built with a really simple game mechanic of the web swinging, which hadn’t really been done in any previous games, and like Spiderman games, and it was probably 3D, even if the graphics weren’t brilliant, it was the first game I really felt like Spiderman, swinging through the city, or when, I remember Zelda Ocarina of Time came out, the music and the storytelling just made you feel like you were going back in time and you were really doing these things, and I guess that’s probably why I didn’t really get into, like shooter games until recently because I never really feel immersed in them, because they’re social and like, yeah I’m competitive and I like playing with my friends and they’re fun to play, but on my own I would never play like a Call of Duty story mode or anything, like because I just don’t feel as immersed in that.  I think I like getting, like the games I play are sort of fantasy, but like superhero games and stuff like that, it’s so different than what like reality is, and it’s different than movies, well I love movies as well, I’m studying, I’m a film student.  But the whole idea of control over that medium, or control over like a fantasy realm or something that’s from reality is really appealing and that’s how I feel immersed in it, because you’re controlling where the character goes, what they do, or how a scenario unfolds.  
Interviewer: Right, so would you say then that your sense of agency within that world, that narrative world or the fantasy world is something that’s key to your enjoyment?
Respondent 8: Yeah, absolutely, once a game starts feeling like old and there’s nothing left to do – so I play some of the Grand Theft Auto games on PlayStation 2 and I’ve played the new one as well on PS3, and the story mode was over, it felt really empty to me and so I stopped playing after that, whereas games that I’d replay over and over because of the story and how I like get invested in it.  Like my favourite are games that are pretty story-heavy, like driven games that I would replay, not just for game mechanics, but yeah, because of how you sort of fit into that role. 
Interviewer: You mentioned two ways of playing basically, sort of on your own being immersed individually and also together with other players if you’re doing something like a FPS or something.  How do you – what are the different ways that you connect with other players?  Is it through being together, physically together and playing, or?
Respondent 8: Yeah, so I never really played – my brother was never into video games, only with my little sister, so when I was younger I’d only play games when I went to a friends’ house, like against them, otherwise, or I’d play with them at my house.  When PS3 came out, I didn’t pay it much attention, I had a few games that I bought, but I never really went into online playing ‘til I guess coming to uni, our other roommate has a PS3 and got me into a few more games that we play online, and when I got, like started playing with my Steam account a lot of my friends had, you know, played CS-Go on Steam and other than that – like at uni I guess a lot of people come round to like the house often, or friends round, they still play like PlayStation 2, so go off with them, but right now, yeah that’s why I want to buy a PS4 because the PS3 is fine, but like it’s moving on and a lot of my friends that are really having fun with new games coming out, that’s, like that online experience is something I want to try and it’s not really there as much with older consoles now. 
Interviewer: So that’s the way you think things are headed, that these new, the new versions of the platforms and the consoles and that are headed more for an online experience, social experience?
Respondent 8: Yeah, I mean I think it’s definitely –the feel of play, a land party, like if friends come over with their laptops and we’re sitting around each other like playing, I think that’s a different experience than playing online which would be more casual.  I don’t think people always want a really social experience, like now everyone’s going to get up, you know, every single time and all go to the same location to play, but if everyone’s home and at their computer, that’s, yeah a little bit more casual.  But like, I would still massively prefer at times, like how fun it is to do a social thing, but I think, I don’t know if that’s like a really shared belief.  Like I think people do enjoy that, but when it’s so easy to do it online, I can’t imagine that won’t just continue to increase in popularity.  
Interviewer: Okay, good.  Well I’ll just move onto the next slide here, so I’ve brought up these, the slide with some of these key words, and as you can see we’ve covered a few of these, the platforms, and which games, how much time, your experience, other players, game types, oh what about money?  
Respondent 8: I guess I would, when I was younger birthdays, Christmas were how I got money to buy the games, or people gave me games.  I guess, and then that’s maybe why I held onto those ones until I started working, like I’ve only started to think about a PlayStation 3 now because I’ve started getting more money.  I’m thinking, like when my parents bought me a PlayStation 3, like me and my brother, like thinking, oh man, that was like a few hundred pounds, like this is sweet, we might as well get some games for it.  Like now, like I know that if I worked for a bit I can save enough money to get a PlayStation 4, which like in the last few years I would never thought about spending like that much of my own money.  
Respondent 8: Now that is becoming easier but I guess, like kids are still like getting hold of PlayStation 4’s, like if I was ten, I would ask for one for Christmas, and like, so I don’t think it’s just coming with – well games are really expensive now as well.  Like the big ones that come out, like they used to be around thirty-pounds I remember for a new game, like on PlayStation 2, like a really like current one, and now you can get like sixty-pounds, like DLC comes into it as well, which people – like the whole reason that the new Star Wars Battlefront 2, that I didn’t, you know, get really excited about it was because of just how much money I would spend to get all the DLC, to actual storyline, which is why I played it on PlayStation 2.  
Respondent 8: But now that I’ve, you know, I’m getting like a little bit more money, I can definitely see how that would, you know, I think it’ll change, I’m definitely not going to buy games that I don’t want, I don’t think.  Like, I think that was the case when I was younger and I had like limited money, when I would buy a game I would know that I really wanted it, and like that, I think that’s why I have a good experience with games, whereas I want to keep that up, I don’t want to just like buy a game and see if it’s good.  I listen to a few podcasts and like, and watched like E3, you know, press conferences when they come up, so I try to keep sort of on the ball, and you can usually tell like what does really well in the shops and what gets priority.  But yeah, as I get older I think it’s going to be easier to buy the games that I want but I don’t think I’ll ever just, you know, so you don’t own it. 
Interviewer: Good okay.  So let’s move onto the next general theme now, the next slide, which is games and the individual.  So we’re thinking now about what sort of influences, impacts the games, and game playing could have on the individual, and their game playing experience.  You mentioned earlier things like the motivation you get through narrative, through immersion and so forth, those sort of aspects.  
"Respondent 8: Yeah, well obviously it can work as like escapism, like everyone, like I think that’s the main reason why it’s so exciting, especially like with kids; when I was bored and there’s not much to do, that’s a great way to spend your time because of how much you feel a part of it and that is really healthy, there’s also the puzzle solving aspects, not necessarily just puzzle games but like a lot of the RPGs that I play, like the same reason why, when I teach gymnastics it’s a lot about problem-solving and at that age when minds are still developing as well through like being younger, the idea of problem-solving being natural through movement is like similar to, if you can make problem-solving feel natural in a game that’s really beneficial as well, you get a release when you’ve actually completed something which when you first see it isn’t, you know, completely clear, but using like skills that you’ve learnt through a game naturally and feeling like that character and how they would react in a situation it feels natural that it flows well, and I think that’s really good."
Respondent 8: Do you mean the effects, like positive effects the games to have on me?
Interviewer: Well it could be both, positive and negative as well.  Some people, I don’t know, I guess you’ve heard of some people talking about potential or imagined negative impacts that games might have.
"Respondent 8: Like I mentioned escapism, that can always be healthy, like if someone is far to – I guess everything does come in moderation and like I think games aren’t so dangerous that they can snare you to become addicted so easily and then addictive personalities become addicted to anything, and because games are such a positive experience and people can get a lot of joy from them, I think that’s a dangerous way of using it, because if someone, you know, really isn’t happy and just spends all of their escaped then they’re not dealing with the reality, which is dangerous.  But someone who, you know, I don’t think games are too dangerous that that’s a common place thing, especially like recent games; I’ve never really liked, the reason why I never felt immersed in Call of Duty games, it’s just because that it never appealed to me, but I remember like, even when I was younger, my parents like not liking the ideas of those games because they were scared that it was violence.  And I guess those never really appealed to me, so I don’t really see that aspect of it, but in like the same way, like video game violence is, are not because it’s violent, but because of the situation.  "
Respondent 8: So I think you just sort of have to be mature about it and view the video game as a video game, a lot of people don’t and they start thinking of it like reality, like that’s the point where it gets dangerous.  But for someone who’s able to regulate how they view reality I think that’s fine, yeah, there you go, I haven’t thought about that for a while.
Interviewer: Right, so you’d say it depends on a certain sense on how balanced a player might be if they have difficulty dealing with reality, or balancing out their?
Respondent 8: Yeah, I mean I think it can, it doesn’t necessarily just have to go down that road, like if people are struggling with things, I think absolutely games will help, I think it’ll make you feel, like you were saying about problem-solving, it doesn’t like – like a distraction from problems is fine, like if people are completely ignoring their problems and spending all of their time, that’s the very dangerous side of it, but if you’re, you know, studying for exams and you’re feeling stressed like it will genuinely make you feel better to play thirty-minutes of like a game, you’re relaxing and release endorphins, and of course that’s a healthy way to escape necessarily, as long as you are able to not over-indulge.
Respondent 8: Like a lot of my mum’s frustration when I was younger was when she’d like call me for dinner and I would say, yeah, yeah, I’m coming, I’m coming, five minutes, five minutes, and I had to save and in my mind it was impossible that she didn’t understand how important it was that I had to save, but you know, obviously that’s a very light example of it.  Like I understand that it can have its dangers, but you know, I don’t think it’s particularly a problem, well a lot of it is a problem, but not, you know, very relevant, at least to me. 
Interviewer: Okay, fine, good.  Okay so let’s have a look at some of the – now we’ve moved onto the next slide with the key words that have come up, some of those that have come up around games and the individual and you’ve mentioned a few there, the question of addiction, immersion, engagement and you also talked a lot about the cognitive areas of things like problem-solving and attention and so forth.  What about collaboration and competition, how do you see that?
Respondent 8: I was just thinking like literally the past few days about how I am competitive just in the broad scheme of my life, how that can be helpful and how it can be negative if people become too cocky and stuff.  But in terms of video games I don’t know if that’s a big part of what sculpted me to become competitive, but that was always like something I did and I have become, I think, quite healthily competitive.  
"Respondent 8: Like it’s not in, as simply, like not a physical way, like I’ve been competitive in other aspects of my life, and I haven’t always been physical; I didn’t start doing gymnastics and free running and all that until the last few years of my high school.  So, but I was playing video games all my life and I think it just, yeah I naturally was always competitive, I wanted to beat games, like I didn’t, like I liked being presented with the task of them and if they were fun to do that was even better.  "
Respondent 8: I would play games though that probably now I wouldn’t play as much, because I’ve got like more stuff going on now.  I wouldn’t just play a game to beat it, I now think about, like the games that revisit, I really, really loved, whereas when I was younger and I had loads of free time I was like, oh okay, a good way of spending my time is beating this puzzle, like a game, and I think that is good, it’ll help your mind continue to look at problems and that will teach you how to keep your head in real life situations or to focus on a goal.  
Respondent 8: I think the idea of long-term satisfaction as well, of knowing like – like in Pokémon if you want your Pokémon to be strong, you have to spend a lot of time, you know, earning your points and that can be looked as game mechanic which is, you know, just to make you spend longer doing it, but it like makes you realise that if you work harder it’ll pay off.  You know, and even if people don’t, as kids, don’t make that immediate like connection on a conscious level that just teaching you, yeah if you work for it things will pay off.  
Respondent 8: I think, I don’t know if I became like in interested in sports because of that, I don’t know if that’s a big reason.  I think I’ve also become like a fan of exercise and sport because I am competitive and that’s a big part of my life.  
Interviewer: It’s interesting you say that because talking about this competitive, the two sides of the competitiveness in video games and sports activities, because the other key word there is physical activity which some people see in different ways with regard to video games, how do you see it?
Respondent 8: Yeah, there’s a big stigma about like video games, like anytime it’s shown in like satirical or like comedy show you see like a fat man, like long hair, disgusting, playing a video game and I was thinking about that the other day, like a lot of people who would be referred to as nerds and stuff used to be a lot less, a lot more niche, whereas now everyone plays games, games are very popular. 
Respondent 8: There’s absolutely people at that other end of the spectrum, there are always people who won’t look after their physical health and they’ll use video games as an unhealthy vice and spend all their time in this.  They, I can see how they would make that connection through, for whatever reason, oh life isn’t fun, I can spend my time having fun in a video game, which is very unhealthy and would lead you to not be physically active and lead to further and further problems.  
Respondent 8: So I see how people make that connection but I do think that if like – like I was always brought up to do sport, I never had a negative connotation with it, I just had never found a sport that I was really, really into, until I did – but I was always not against it.  I think a lot of problems with people who use video games unhealthily, might not necessarily come from video games.  If a child is like brought up very, you know, like instantaneous gratification, they can always get what they want, video games will also appeal to them in that sense, in an unhealthy way which is unhealthy, doesn’t do sports and when they don’t want to, like when they feel tired they – I’m not saying it’s probably like the parents’ fault, but like children develop in a certain way and I think people, like in the same way that like people can have additive personalities to anything, that – yeah. 
Interviewer: Okay.  Good, I think at this point we can move on to the next general theme, which as we see is, applications of the games, in the sense of, okay we’ve talked so far about games as a form of entertainment and so forth, there are also other areas in which games are applied to different areas for different specific purposes and outcomes and things.  Do you ever, or have you ever played games with specific purposes, other than entertainment or for other purposes?
"Respondent 8: Yeah, I’ve, when I was at high school I studied Spanish, which I didn’t really like as a subject, but I was keeping it through, because I like Spain, I like going there, and I’d worked on a few, like teams in Spain, I really like it; and when I left school I still wasn’t really into Spanish, I knew I wanted to go back in the future so I wanted to keep up with my Spanish and I heard people talking about like apps, one called Duolingo, done it for a while, and it really helps me like keep up.  I think it can also help people learn, like I tried it on French, like other languages to see, but like it really helped me just to keep up with my Spanish, because if I’m spending a lot of time not talking to anyone, or not practising; like when I was in school I was constantly writing essays so even if I wasn’t brilliant I was always practising, whereas now I just sometimes don’t get an intake of Spanish, so twenty minutes a day doing that really has a positive effect.  But at the same time, I’m not sure – the vast majority of gamers who are into gaming I can see how they wouldn’t be as motivated as that, by that. "
Interviewer: Sure.  
Respondent 8: I don’t think that’s everyone’s cup of tea.  I think if I wasn’t as interested about it, if I didn’t have as big a need to do that, like because I, of why I want to go to Spain.  I mean I could learn any language I want with Duolingo, but I don’t, because I don’t have a desire to do it.  So most people are like lazy, but I remember when, on the DS when those puzzle games were coming out, like Doctor something’s brain training, I heard of a few people playing them and like really enjoying them.  I tried them once or twice and they were okay but I, when I was younger I don’t think I ever would’ve picked that up, but I can see now how if I wasn’t, like in a few years if I wasn’t at uni or I wasn’t doing mental sort of tasks and I wanted to, you know, keep that up that’s why I would do it, absolutely.  So people, I think, they need an objective. 
Interviewer: Fine, so if I understand you correctly, when you’re thinking of these types of games, things, the sort of games people have called either serious games, or games for learning, educational games and so forth, you seem to think that it’s, the initial motivation that you have for learning something, that takes you to the game rather than the game itself creating the motivation. 
Respondent 8: I think it depends on what the game is marketed as, but a game called Brain Training that was simply puzzles never appealed to me, just because when I was younger I didn’t really care about that.  There were people in my class, my friends that did that, they were into that, but I didn’t, whereas if a game came out, like I don’t know if I really played many when I was younger, but if there was a game that I knew genuinely would have beneficial effects and help me like learning things.  I don’t think I played many games now that really teach me, you know, much about, like actual subjects, but more about problem-solving in that way.  But I’d definitely play, if it was fun enough I would absolutely do it, but it depends on what, like what is the game.  
Respondent 8: Like if it’s just, if it’s simply you’re learning from this, like I would see this in school and the same aspects that I didn’t like, like sitting in maths, I knew I was learning and it was beneficial for me, and I would note that, but I think that a lot of people who play games are people who are pretty, you know, I don’t know how to say it, like just kind of, short attention span maybe.  
Interviewer: I was thinking, you were mentioning there Duolingo, which is, I think it’s like a sort of gamified sort of environment right, where they’ve added in things like points and badges and leader boards and stuff like that. 
Respondent 8: Yeah, yeah. 
Interviewer: Have you ever tried any other forms of gamification like that?
Respondent 8: I’m not sure now, well when I was doing my driving theory, for my driving test, the app that I had was, you know, like I went through that it was easier than like going over the book.  And then, you know, in the hazard one you watch a video and it’s like playing a video game where you have to do that, and you’re just sitting there.  But then there’s VR experiences that I would really love to do, like there’s – I’m a vegetarian and there’s ones I’ve heard of, which show people all the stuff, and I can see how, for me, I would like look at that, okay that’s, it’s pure looking at, like it’s fun, but it’s actually going to have benefits of showing people these things, and like, even though it’s a biased view, like you can have that for anything.  
"Respondent 8: Like my granddad works with the company Spar, it’s like a newsagents or whatever, but like in some bigger ones where they’re like grocery stores, they’re not going to do it like anytime soon, but for VR you could show people like where the food came from, you could show people that it’s Fairtrade and like all these things, like there are educational purposes.  I think VR’s a big place that gaming is going, so for actually giving you the experience of what it’s like to do things, like, and being educational in that purpose, like you could, even your home you could be present at a science experiment or witnessing something that, you know; and a lot of people, I think, in culture are becoming visual learners because I think people are, you know, our attention spans are becoming shorter and people are move akin to instant gratification and gamification in that sense.  It could be very helpful in a school environment or university if you could go to a lecture. "
Interviewer: Sure.  Okay, good.  So I’ve just put up the next slide here, with some of the key words that have come up with applied games and application of games.  So we’ve mentioned things like school and learning, and serious games, supportive dimensions and gamification.  There’s also earning with games. 
Respondent 8: Okay, yeah I’ve never, I don’t, I’ve never spent money on games, like there’s an app called Clash of Clans, that wasn’t even a very fun game but I played for months and I spent about twenty-pounds on it.  I don’t know when you could earn with games and like, what sort of scenario do you mean?
Interviewer: Well it could be things like eSports for example, or You Tubers stuff like that. 
Respondent 8: I’ve got a few friends, they use betting apps and stuff like that, or on their phone and my friend was talking the other day he’s invested in Bitcoin.  I think I can, I’m usually not, like quite switched on to like things like that, of knowing.  I don’t think I’d be good at, you know, investing or keeping my ear on the pulse because I’m too, I don’t think I’m just, you know, I think I’m too lazy for that.  But I’ve got friends who do, I’ve got friends that like bet regularly and they watch the stats and it’s not just about thinking, who’s going to win, they – like my friend was telling me about it and saying, just how you can use the system of like looking at statistics and absolutely, it happens and like I’m sure all these bigger skills that I don’t know of. 
Interviewer: While we’re on this subject actually, this could have some ethical implications, we’ll move onto the next general topic, which is ethical issues.  So thinking about, I don’t know if you’ve experienced in your gaming, your game play experience where there are some ethical dimension that has come into it, that may have attracted your attention, or concerned you, or you’ve heard about people debating about ethical issues in gaming and games. 
Respondent 8: Yeah, there is, I remember a big scandal when the most recent Grand Theft Auto came out, there was a scene where you have to perform torture, and I remember hearing about it beforehand and I’d bought the game as well, and I remember just like thinking to myself, like oh I can see where people are coming from on that.  I could say the game did happen in a way, at the end, even though you are immersed in doing that activity, which like I didn’t enjoy doing it, but afterwards it progressed the story, the character has a conversation afterwards where he, you are playing as if torturing, where he mentions the torture isn’t effective and explains why it actually doesn’t help, it fits the narrative because your character is meant to be quite crazy and like a gangster and like a bad person.  It puts – so it’s good character development for him, you do learn about that, and I remember people just being so worried and how that affects you and like being scared that you’re putting children, it’s an eighteen rated game, so if children were playing it, which I know, like children will always get hold of things, like I was able to get eighteen games before I was eighteen.  Like, you know, it’s not like rare, but I do think that’s important, like games are rated for a reason, and that game was played with the intent that someone eighteen years old plus would hopefully have, you know, be mature enough to understand that situation with the intent that it was given.
Respondent 8: I think there are games that are, that I wouldn’t be able to defend.  There was one that came out in the last few years that I remember hearing about where it was a suicidal man that you play as, who thinks that he’s possessed by the devil and your whole goal is to kill as many people as possible, and people will justify that and say, oh it’s just a game, it’s like, it’s being entertaining, you’re not doing it in real life, but I don’t see any part of that narrative, like helps, you know, a gamer become better in any way other than like, I don’t think the new games normalise violence, but I think, you know, as far as that does normalise, I don’t think that should ever be presented as a normal objective.  But, whereas I’ve, you know, I don’t disagree that putting in torture in that game was, you know, a bad move, I understand where it comes from and I also, I think like, if one’s used well and you know what’s going to happen before you do it, you can skip missions in the game.  
Respondent 8: I remember one, there’s a Call of Duty game, when it came out and you have to murder people in an airport and it gives you an option beforehand that you can decline and not actually do it, but you know, that’s still in the game for no reason you have to do that, and it progresses the story because they then double-cross you and you were an undercover agent as well, and the whole aspect of that scene was to show you that it was all pointless or whatever, but I think context is really, really important and games act as your broad scheme they can show you the experience of anything and not all of those experiences, you know, are good for a person.
"Interviewer: There was one thing you mentioned that was interesting about GTA, talking about playing, this very like hard-core sort of negative if you like, character, who does the torture and so forth; and you also mentioned about the RPGs at the beginning then, so it’s got this thing, there’s this idea of taking on a particular identity, or a different identity from your own personal identity perhaps, experimenting with identities, do you see that as having something that could have ethical issues connected with it?"
Respondent 8: Yeah, I mean, I think that also, it’s just a broad scheme, like I could bring it back to like film for a bit.  There’s an aspect of film which is like broadly explored where you make your main character a blank slate, Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker and, there was another good example, they’re made a certain way, they’re made to be relatable, so that they’ve got very big characteristics.  When I play games, like a lot of the ones that I really, really enjoyed as a young kid were like superhero ones, or ones where you felt, like fantasy ones where you were playing as a hero, because their characteristics are very vague.  What you learn from them is that they’re honourable, they’re good and they’re doing things for a good cause. There’s not even, like in some cases, like Superman games where that’s the only objective your character has because it’s the right thing to do, and I’ve always liked those games, because they make you feel like a hero, but they were very vague.  
Respondent 8: I think Grand Theft Auto, when I was – I never played that when I was younger, so I don’t know if that would’ve had an impact on me.  I think, I absolutely, like all the things I like now because of what I was, like even when I read comic books when I was younger, I think that made me probably want to, you know, that made me like gymnastics because I felt like I was doing something superhuman or whatever, it’s aspects like that that maybe they did have an effect on why I did that, or become the way – so I don’t know if I’d played more violent games, but I think it depends on how characterised they are.  
Respondent 8: So in Grand Theft Auto you’re really becoming exposed to like these ideologies and I think Rockstar do a very good job in their characterisation that they don’t paint them in a way that’s trying to convince you that they’re right.  Like, the characters are satirical but, you know, when you’re playing like a war game and the real context is, these are your enemies and you have to kill them because they’re the bad guys.  Like that can, I guess, if your brain is still developing, like if I’d maybe played that when I was younger I can see how that would teach you that in some instances there’s no other option but to do this, which to someone who isn’t in war, is never a healthy way to be thinking. 
Respondent 8: And I never liked those things I guess, I was never like a real like pacifist or anything when I was younger, I always like, I’ve been playing rugby my entire life, I was never like, didn’t like violence, I never liked things like Call of Duty because it seems so simple to me that like that was the only draw as to who the character was, everything’s so broad.  But also like, I didn’t like how maybe realistic it was and I don’t know, I prefer that when I, I was playing a game and I hit an enemy the – well I guess that’s teaching kids that if they, like they can get points if they hit enemies, but I would prefer to see a star come out of my enemy and collect it knowing that I was progressing the game, the focus is on the game as opposed to actually, like in Assassin’s Creed, like which is still a game I really enjoy, you follow the characters and then like murder them, it’s for a good cause maybe, but it’s still pretty vague and I guess those games can be fun, but I think I, I was exposed to when I was younger and I think it’s the best way that – well I don’t know if it’s the best way, but it’s maybe the easiest way to avoid people maybe who do have addictive, or tendencies that pick up on the people that they’re admiring in this game, like I see how that can be dangerous. 
Interviewer: I’ll take you back a bit when you were talking a couple of points, you made parallels with films, okay.  I was thinking that, there’s now, as we now all see at the time, with the film industry and the film realm, there’s a lot of attention to identity in films, the identity of characters, who they represent, if they’re representing different genders, different races, different sexual orientations, and so forth, and there’s a lot of talk about it, how much of the different ways, different identities are presented in film.  How do you feel that pans out in video games?
"Respondent 8: The same reason that my favourite films are ones I feel like I can relate to personally, like I prefer that to escapism.  I mean they can still be escapism in a way, but if it’s got a hint of reality it helps you feel more, you know, like it resonates with you a lot more.  Even with characteristics, not even with, you know, colour or like race, orientation, if there’s a characteristic that you see in a character when you watch them and you think, oh my goodness that’s like me, you can resonate more with it.  And so, also the games that I like to play the most are like usually male driven games; I’ve played several female orientated games and did not, I didn’t really care, I definitely prefer to play as males.  "
Respondent 8: One of my favourite games Portal, you play as a girl but you never see her because it’s from an entirely first-person view.  I never saw that character as a boy, I always knew it was a girl, but I think I, I have in the past like looked at a game and thought, oh, you know, it doesn’t look as good and it’s a female character.  So I already am not interested in it, but I now know that like it’s going to be slightly harder for me to resonate with it.  But when I’ve played games that I have enjoyed that are females, it’s interesting, because you probably don’t see her at all, but I have, I’ve played games where you know that you’re playing as a girl, and I have been so immersed in what their story is, in the same way that, I like a lot of films that resonate with me, but a lot of films that are really great show you something new that you don’t know about, the experience of life and a game can do that as well.  I’m trying to think of like, of any specific games I’ve played as a girl, that’s probably the biggest one to me of, I do think that people want more, they want to be, I can’t think of the word, they want their race or gender, or orientation to be like shown in the mainstream and they want games like that so they can, you know, resonate with them.  
"Respondent 8: I think that is absolutely a good idea, like I know that I understand how I’m lucky to be the key demographic of a lot of games, and so, so many games are key to my demographic.  But you know, when I was younger probably one of my favourite games ever was Prince of Persia and you’re playing as the Prince of Persia through Persia, and I thought he was the coolest guy ever, he was good at free running and it was a well-crafted game, and that didn’t bother me, also he was like, you know, still a man; unlike, I’ve never played a game that was so differently, I’m played games that aren’t as humans, but I’ve never played a game that was a human that was so, so, so different to me, because I haven’t heard of one that’s sounded interesting enough, or I just haven’t, you know, yeah, that’s really it. "
Interviewer: Okay, good.  So let’s, I’ll just bring up these key words in the next slide that have come up related to those ethical issues.  So we’ve mentioned I think a lot of those with things like violence and aggression and identity and diversity and stuff.  There’s also monetisation, do you think there’s an ethical dimension to that as well. 
Respondent 8: I think the games that use monetisation the best do it in a good way.  Saints Row I enjoyed for the writing, much more than the immersification of the character in a situation.  The writing is funny, so when they do like product placements, I think it’s been done well in the same way that – I think it can be harder in movies because it has to be so subtle and, but also like for DLC, like things like that, I think when you buy a game it would be great if it comes as its own package, like it can have add-ons, but if you need the add-ons for the full package, Star Wars Battlefront is my example for that.  If that had come out with all the DLC as a full game, including some of the DLC that’s only coming out in the next two months, which looks like, you know, would’ve been the best part of the game, if it had come out as part of the game – I think that is unethical.  I don’t like being squeezed for money that, even though it’s a great experience, if you sold it for as much money as the DLC will cost people probably wouldn’t buy it.  
Respondent 8: But I also know that with a lot of work in games becoming harder and a bigger scale that like, you know, companies want to make money back, but I think they already do on such a scale that, things like that is unethical.  
Interviewer: Good, okay.  So let’s now then move onto the next general them, which is games in society, so thinking about the sort of influences, or impacts that games, game playing and gaming you think could or might have, or will have on society in the future?
"Respondent 8: Well I think games are becoming much more commonplace, the world is becoming in general more accepting of things, and whereas on a lot of like old TV and movies a nerd character is often associated with like playing a lot of games and that is looked as a negative characteristic.  But I guess people over time have actually realised, there’s so many different types of games and they’re so broad that like there is almost, like there is a game for everybody; it’s like music.  It’s not thought of as a weird thing that some people do, I’m not saying everyone plays games, but I don’t think there’s really anywhere I’ve, anyone I’ve met that I wouldn’t look down upon more because they played games, and I don’t think, like in society, well obviously in different societies it’s different, but especially in the UK, I don’t think like, you know, cool people can still play games, celebrities play games, like rappers play games and they live stream them, celebrities, like YouTube people make a lot of money off playing games.  "
"Respondent 8: So it’s not, I don’t think it’s become, you know, looked down upon I think it’s going to become more and more normal and I also, I think with our society becoming more instant gratification, like people will be playing more games as, I don’t think, as opposed to like films, I don’t think it’s going to overtake it, but I think the whole going – I think society, maybe I’m biased, because I am a film student, but I think that it looks as though people are spending a lot more time wanting to be entertained by things and spending time out of reality, which I don’t like the idea of; I like the idea of it pairing with what you feel like as a person and taking that into real life, so that when – like I still play Assassin’s Creed because the free running is good, even though I can do that in real life, not on such a scale, but like, I’m not doing that to escape because I am sick of, you know, I want to progress the way, styles of thinking that I like to do in my normal day that I think will continue to like, but like not everyone would have that point of view, or the thing that someone thinks about.  "
Respondent 8: So I see how it does become dangerous and if people are spending all of their time, you know, just watching binge TV or playing a game until it’s completed, non-stop without interacting with real people, people will be appealed, like that’s appealed to some people, like the idea of just switching off for that long, people will like, and I think that’s, yeah dangerous if it keeps going that way.  I think it probably, but I also think people are becoming switched on more to when things like that do become dangerous and I think the way that games are made and people are making them, the people that review them and the people that play them are getting a better understanding of how to play games safely.  
Respondent 8: Like people know that it’s dangerous to become addicted to things, so you know, like if people are noticing the signs of that, like if I had a child and they were spending all of their time playing in their room I wouldn’t let them just do it, in the same way that like if they weren’t talking to anyone because they were too shy, I would do things to like help them, you know, just encourage them and help them see why gaming isn’t everything.  And you know, sometimes like it does, it would take people around you to do that, but I think people realise the danger of games, they are becoming a better form of entertainment, which isn’t a bad thing, but when some things are a better forms of entertainment people might prefer it to how their life feels. 
Interviewer: Okay.  Good, so I’m just putting up the next slide here with some of the key words that have come up with games and society.  You were talking about social impact and social implications there, what about the cultural side of it, do you think there’s a cultural angle in the way games may have influenced, or are influencing or society?
Respondent 8: I think that – well as people spend more time playing games and watching TV people understand what good games are more and more.  If a game came out now, that came out like ten years’ ago would be heralded as the best game of its time, like I think that’s, I don’t know how that really – yeah, I guess we’re becoming more impressed by them, so it’s easier to – people want good games, good games, games are becoming better, people are playing, that’s why I think it’s becoming more popular, they are [in our culture 0:58:23], I’m sure it’s really just like, I mean you hear references about it because they’re getting better and they’re more popular, more people like to play them, so it’s becoming like a thing to talk about on TV.  It’s becoming something to talk about in, you know, I don’t know, do you mean like, is it between different cultures? 
Respondent 8: I guess a lot of big games are American produced and I know there are, there’s Swedish games that I’ve played that are fantastic, but I don’t know, I know that a lot of American games are popular, you know, out of America and it’s more of a niche thing to see, you know, I don’t think I’ve played many French games.  Like I know perhaps some companies come from all over the world, but the games that I play have usually been tailored to my kind of audience and if I was making a game I would do the same.  
Respondent 8: But, well like – yeah, like I don’t really keep on top of what other countries’ games are, I know there’s probably some fantastic ones, just because of the amount that are in English, or are easier for me to get, that’s what I continue to do, and maybe in, someone from France loves playing French games, but maybe because how popular Call of Duty is, or they’ll just play games like that, I’m not sure if I, you know, they [1:00:24].
Interviewer: Okay good.  So now if we just move on to the last, let’s say the conclusive part of the interview, we ask everyone that we interview if they have any particular suggestions to put forward to different, let’s say different groups, different players in games and gaming, and gaming communities, such as players, but also developers, researchers, educators, policy makers, whatever, parents, whether they have any suggestions that they would make based on your experience and how you see it, whether you would offer some suggestions about how to either avoid problems, or ways of taking games and gaming forward.
Respondent 8: I think in terms of bringing gaming forward I think the biggest that, it has been picked up on by production companies and they are doing, but it really is important that people catch on, is to listen to the audiences and the same with films.  It’s obviously, like supply and demand and if you make what people want, so like right now, people don’t want just like – I think the newest, the Call of Duty trailer, the new one was World War II, which is a stark contrast to the one which was the future and that video on YouTube was disliked, like vastly in like percentages.  People hated it, it wasn’t well received, so the next thing they did was, further things in the future, it’s the past and people love it.  Listening to your audience is brilliant. 
Respondent 8: I think in terms of understanding gaming of how it can be dangerous is, in the same way that there’s a bad stigma around free running when people think that it’s daredevils who are vandalising property and stuff, I find it pretty hard to have a genuine conversation with some people about how, you know, it can be positive and all the great things that can come with learning through movement and problem-solving and trying to be respectful through it, but some people just don’t want to hear that, and the same way with video games.  I think a willingness to learn about the thing, about the actual motif is pretty important.  I think people who complain a lot about video games, I think people have absolutely got, you know, reasonable problems with them that we need to address and learn about and work on for future games, but a lot of people that would just say, oh someone’s spending a lot of time playing video games, they must be unhealthy, they must do this, but when there are a lot of people who play a lot, on a lot of the video games, but also make sure they spend time being healthy and with jobs, or school or family and also do enjoy it as a way of relaxing, maybe more so than other people would like to spend time going out for drinks, or going out to eat with friends, some people would prefer to do that, and I think that’s, there needs to be an understanding of not everyone sees it as black and white.  Some people see it as a waste of time, and they think anyone that does it is wasting their time, and I think people need to just understand more about the things they have problems with, but also that gamers understands that we can’t just do whatever people want and that it can be dangerous in the aspects there is.
Interviewer: So who do think, what sort of particular groups if you like of people do you think could do most to help break down those sort of stigmas that you’re talking about?
Respondent 8: I think if games, like I did – there’s games that I would be able to defend honestly and think that I could put across a good defence that I would never be able to show to my grandparents as like, you know, I think Grand Theft Auto is a good game and it helps us learn about how in reality things don’t necessarily go like that, and to understand that.  But I don’t think that means that people who don’t understand just don’t get a voice on it, I think that if games were, it’s done now cleverly in some cases, but if games continue to be well, like well-marketing I guess, you know what you’re getting with it.
Respondent 8: Like if a game comes out with something scandalous I don’t see how that would ever not be a scandal to the people who will take it like that, but I think in society we’re working towards people who don’t just jump to conclusions as much, like that’s becoming a very unpopular thing to do, because it gets people in like a lot of, now I think culture’s very keen on pointing out people when they’re wrong and stuff, and also defending like when games, controversies come out, there are places to hear both sides of the story.  
Respondent 8: So like it’s good that, when people will have genuine problems, like you know, they will be able to hopefully learn more about it, if the game developers can, not necessarily that they have to explain everything they do, but make their intent clear with context and the new developments, and people in general to try to be understanding is the best you could sort of ask for.  But if you can make it as easy as possible for people who aren’t necessarily going to be understanding, to understand then that will be good.
Interviewer: Great.  So I’m just showing there some of the different groups that have been mentioned in terms of different sorts of suggestions, made for taking games forward and just to conclude, as I mentioned at the beginning we’d like to give you a chance to, if there’s anything you want to add, or to comment on, either about what we’ve been talking about, or about the interview itself, you’re free to ask anything. 
Respondent 8: Yeah, on there, there’s two key words through the sides that I didn’t comment on, that I then thought about afterwards.  So there’s one, sports therapy, and I don’t necessarily know, I’ve never used video games to gamify action recovery and things, but when I wanted to learn free running there are several apps that I paid for that were, as if they were video tutorials, they’re happy to put them out, their own apps of how they, you know, give tips on certain tricks and I would buy every extension for all the different moves, because, of what it was for me, and that helped my sports and stuff like that is available on YouTube, but the fact that you could unlock these different things and it was sort of, if it was like a hard thing to get, it was a hard thing to obtain and it was maybe how niche that was, that also appealed to it, it was like, oh I’m getting this special advice from my favourite athlete, not a lot of people are getting this, like as an objective, like that’s not necessarily gamifying it, but on apps and stuff like that, that helped me with that and that can be helpful.
"Respondent 8: So then when you mentioned groups, parents, although I did mention, absolutely, I think one of the biggest ones; but I [1:09:08] where I think parents are responsible for a lot, because I work with children.  I see my friends, I see the parents at the gym where I work, a lot of the kids I work with are from, like one right up until like twelve, and a lot of what we teach them, parents, like child classes is about how attentive they need to be in their development of exercise.  So like a lot of the parents when they’re sitting in there, there’s a glass window, they sit beside the kids there and the kids are in there doing sport and some of them don’t look up the entire time, and all the kids want, when I’m teaching them on the inside, all they ever say is like, oh I’m just going to go and see if my mum wants to watch, or like, they want their parents to see them do it, like that’s what excites them about it.  "
Respondent 8: So I’m in a stage right now where I think parents are really important to the development of a lot of things, and especially to the new games.  I know that if I have kids I would be very careful of like what I let them play, at what ages.  I think my parents were always pretty strict on that, I don’t have, like the most strict parents in the world, but if I was fifteen I was never going to play an eighteen.  
Respondent 8: I think I got an eighteen when I was seventeen, from like my friends and things, but like having parents who regularly hit that sort of thing, kids will always want to be rebellious and stuff, but helping children understand why a bad game isn’t worth playing, and it’s not just that, oh it’s bad, don’t do it, but helping children understand, oh that’s about this, we don’t want to play games like, we don’t do that in this house.  I think that’s an important aspect of gaming, and parents can have a lot of sway around – like if my dad had told me when I was like twelve, like he’d play games with me sometimes, it was like when he read one of the last Harry Potter books, he wouldn’t read a chapter to me because it was too gory when I was younger, and like not all parents would do that, and I can see how people would see that as strict, but like for a young child, if I was playing a game and my dad said, oh the next level’s really scary, if I was young enough I think I would, and it genuinely would’ve been too scary, I think that I would at least, you know, heeded that advice a bit, and thought okay.
Respondent 8: Not every child will do that, but if they understand why, like when I was young I didn’t want to be particularly scared by anything, like I wouldn’t have wanted to be in fear and if a game has actually scared I wouldn’t have wanted that.  Like I never really got into horror movies until I was older, for the same reason, like now, but I would never let, like if I had a fifteen year old child I would never let them watch an eighteen movie.  So I think that’s a big aspect, and kids will do stuff without thinking things through, that’s just the way children are sometimes, and even like some adults aren’t very good at regulating that.  But parents can provide help in that area. 
Interviewer: Right, [anonymised]ua, it’s interesting you’ve mentioned that specific case of your work in the gym and the parents behind the glass and perhaps not participating, or not signalling their participation in their kids’ activities, and when you talked about parents and games, you mentioned mostly about filtering, like keeping them away or warning them or protecting, but do you think there’s also that, there’s also scope for that sort of active, some way participation or acknowledgement of parents in their kids’ game play?
Respondent 8: Yeah, especially for, I mean I would always have like friends that I could play with, like when I was younger like before online and stuff, like when I was really young, before online was a bigger thing, it would be a rare thing that you would get to come round to your house to play with a friend.  So if my sister or my dad, or my mum, would play – like my mum would never play, my brother hated games, my sister played sometimes, but my dad would sometimes play with me on some games, not all, like I understand like what’s not his cup of tea, but like there’s snowboarding games and a few games that I would always, like he would play with me at times and I really enjoyed that, and like if my dad wanted to play in the same way that I would play a co-op game with one of my mates, like if my dad was up for it, I would one-hundred percent would play with him.
Respondent 8: But I do think like in different cases it’s different, like I – there are friends of mine whose parents I’ve played video games with, like my mates would play FIFA with their dads and stuff, that would be normal, but I wouldn’t necessarily play a game with my mum, or my dad wouldn’t play, like stuff as much, because maybe they’re not interested.  I imagine there’s games that if my dad really spent time trying to get into he would absolutely love it.  I don’t think it’s like a necessity, I’m not saying parents absolutely have to, you know, to find what games they like so they could play with their kids, but that is something that if you can share that with your kid, in the same way that if you and your child have a same sport that you both enjoy, that helps you like bond with that and also you have a respect there.  
Respondent 8: Like when my dad was like, like when I was younger my dad would play football and stuff, I would listen to what he would say about football, because he was better than me and I wanted to like learn how to be better.  My sister, like any time she has played video games, like she would listen to what I say, she would still ask for help and stuff, and there’s, like it comes with respect.  I think it’s a good aspect, it’s not necessarily something that all parents would have, would have to do as a, you know, as just a rule, but it absolutely could be beneficial. 
Interviewer: Okay, great.  Well unless there’s anything you want to add to that now, or if there’s anything else you want to ask me about, I think we can-
Respondent 8: I think I’ve rambled on about a lot of subjects. 
Interviewer: No, it’s great, there’s a lot of really, really interesting stuff in there, I think it’s going to be really good when we sit down and start analysing the interview and stuff.  There’s a lot of really interesting stuff in there. 

Interview 9:
Interviewer: Yes.  I will explain to you how this interview is structured, because as I said we are interested in your experience with games and in your thoughts about gaming and society.  I will share some slides, you should be able to see shortly.
Respondent 9: Yeah.
Interviewer: Great.  We will explore six themes.  These will guide our conversation and there will be some keywords like this which you are free to use, you are not required to talk about all these topics, but you can use them as cues to help you collect your thoughts and think about maybe something that didn’t come to your mind.
Respondent 9: Sounds good.
Interviewer: Feel free to ask me to repeat what I am saying if my accent is bothering you (laughs).
Respondent 9: I will, but I’m sure I won't, don’t worry.
Interviewer: Do you have any other questions?
Respondent 9: No, that all sounds good.
Interviewer: We will begin by talking about your experience with gaming.  What do you play, how much do you play and what role games have in your life?
Respondent 9: I’ve been playing games since I was about two I think on my dad’s laptop.  When I was about three or four we got a bunch of old home PCs – well, old home computers, we got a Spectrum, a Commodore, an Amstrad and an Electron, and they came with about three thousand cassettes or something mad like that.  I just completely fell in love with them.  Since then I’ve owned most consoles that came out since then, I’ve got a PS1, a PS4, an N64 Game Cube, an XBox, an XBox 360, I’ve had a bunch of PCs, a bunch of laptops.  I can't even begin to imagine how many games I have now and how many games I’ve played.
Respondent 9: I kind of changed a little bit in terms of what kinds of games I like to play.  When I was very young and just playing home computer games it was just whatever games were there I liked.  When I was in my teenage years it was very much real-time strategy games.  One of which I played very competitively and became one of the five best players in the online ranking system.  Which was Red Alert 2 Command Conquer.
Respondent 9: Then after that I got slightly more into first person shooters, played Counterstrike quite competitively for a while but also Team Fortress and Halo and things like that.  I had always enjoyed card games but when I was about eighteen I discovered poker so I was playing online poker and started making money at that and started making a living at that.  And I intended just to play poker as my life until the end of my undergrad degree when I decided to do a PhD and to quit poker.  So I did that, and quit poker and started doing a PhD.
Respondent 9: At that point I was playing a few RTS games but mostly indie games, also EVE online.  And since then I’ve mostly been into indie games and these days I’m a games academic and I make games.  I also do lots of freelance writing about games.  And games are probably my number one or my number two life passion I guess.  
Interviewer: I can see that.
Respondent 9: There you go.
Interviewer: How much do you play in a typical day or week?
Respondent 9: These days sadly way less than I’d like to.  Because academia is fairly demanding and fairly competitive.  These days, I don't know, maybe – probably no more than one hour a day at the absolute most.  Probably more like half an hour a day or like one hour every two days type of thing.  Something like that I’d say.  More in the past during my PhD I definitely played at least two hours a day.  These days, probably half an hour a day, one hour every two days, one hour every three days, something like that. 
Respondent 9: But to make up for that I watch a lot of games on Twitch.  A lot of the time when I work I watch other people playing games in the background, which is partly for enjoyment but also partly since as a games scholar I kind of should know what’s going on in games.  But if I don’t have the time to play them then I have to watch someone else playing just to keep up with what’s taking place in the games world which I don’t have time to play.
Interviewer: You said you played mostly on any platform I can think of.
Respondent 9: I’ve never played handheld games which is not because I don’t like them, I just never got into handheld gaming.
Interviewer: And mobile?
Respondent 9: I’ve never played mobile games, no, I’ve always been PC/console.
Interviewer: So there is one kind of games you don’t play (laughs).
Respondent 9: Yes.
Interviewer: Do you play also single player or only multiplayer competitively?
Respondent 9: Only single player.  I don’t have the time it would take to become good enough at a multiplayer game for me to enjoy playing it basically.  Pretty much only single player games these days.  My multiplayer game peak was between when I was about sixteen and about twenty, when I was playing a lot of RTS games, lots of first person shooters and poker.  But these days I’m purely single player.
Interviewer: So that’s also something that changed when you had less time.
Respondent 9: Yes.
Interviewer: Last thing I want to ask you, and you are free not to answer (laughs), is how much do you spend in games?
Respondent 9: These days very little.  Recently I wanted to play Bloodborne on the PS4 and I didn’t own a PS4, so I bought a PS4 purely to play Bloodborne, making it the most expensive game that I every bought.  But it was definitely worth it.  Broadly speaking I definitely spend under – Bloodborne aside, I definitely spend less than two hundred pounds a year these days.  If you went back to my PhD it would probably be more like three to four hundred pounds a year, if you went back to my undergrad it’d probably be more like five, six hundred a year.  
Interviewer: But it’s a reduction in spending that just came because you are playing less, it’s not something you are actively controlling?
Respondent 9: Definitely.  
Interviewer: Moving on, you played a lot since a very young age, what kind of influence do you think games had on you, or any kind of influence?
Respondent 9: Games have definitely influenced my career path in the sense of when I learnt that one could be a games academic I thought, that sounds like the greatest job on earth, and decided to start doing that.  They definitely influenced me to make games which is what I’m far more well known for than my academic work.  I’d say more people download my game in one day than have ever read every paper I have ever written.  Which is kind of the nature of the job in some ways.  But it’s definitely influenced that.
Respondent 9: On a more philosophical level I guess games have influenced me in the sense of – particularly something like poker, has shown me that luck still plays a huge role in one’s life, even when one works hard and is skilled and all these type of things.  It taught me to think about the long-term rather than the short-term.  And competitive games I guess in general taught me that but poker particularly.  And this was entirely online poker so kind of like a video game.  And those kinds of lessons have definitely been really crucial for me I think.
Respondent 9: It’s definitely helped me meet a huge amount of really amazing cool people.  On the back of my games research I’ve been all over North America and Europe and East Asia on research travel and that’s all been fantastic.  I can genuinely think of nothing negative I’d say that games have done to me or done for me.  I’d say the influence of playing games and more recently studying and making games has been one hundred percent positive.
Interviewer: I’m interested about competition since you played competitively.  Do you think your view on competition changed due to games?  Or even your view on collaboration if you’re playing the team games I mean?
Respondent 9: Yes, the big thing would be the thing I said about that doing well in anything is always a question of the long-term.  There are so many aspects of luck in one’s life that one can't control.  To do well at anything I think means doing well every time until the factors you can't control line up and then you win.  And that applies I think to poker events but also to lots of competitive games in general.  Where if you’re playing 5 V 5 then a lot of your winning or losing is based on your teammates.  And all you can do is play as well as you can every game.  And then over the long-term you will slowly win out based on when the luck facts of how your teammates play line up with you or not.
Respondent 9: I’d say also games have taught me that competition in general – where competition takes place in a space where everyone is able to opt in or opt out, as in a game, I think it’s very healthy and very rich and very enjoyable.  But that any kind of translation from game competition to real world competition and where people are born with massively different advantages and disadvantages and demographic backgrounds and all that type of stuff is hugely detrimental.  One of the beautiful thing about games is that – and this is a slightly sweeping comment – but is that broadly speaking games are a fairly equal playing field I think compared to real life.  And I think that’s one of the best things about them.
Respondent 9: In terms of collaboration.  I don’t know if games have really taught me much about collaboration.  Maybe I spent too much time playing EVE online which is famous for backstabbing and cheating and skulduggery.  Being a games academic and being a game designer have taught me a lot about collaboration but I’m not sure if the actual act of playing games has taught me all that much about collaboration because I tended not to play team based competitive games.  Or when I did – like CS is a team based competitive game but it’s also a game where the individual plays a much bigger role I’d say than something like Dota or League or Heroes of The Storm or that type of thing.  
Respondent 9: So I wouldn’t say games have taught me bad about collaboration but I don’t think they’ve taught me anything particularly positive about collaboration either.  But they have taught me both about the positives and the negatives for competition I think.
Interviewer: Another thing I’d like to ask you, you played a lot of strategy games, poker, which also requires quite a bit of reasoning.  Do you believe that games improved your reasoning capabilities?
Respondent 9: Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt.  I think there’s no chance that I would – not to sound rash – but I don’t think I would be where I am now without having learnt a lot from games and without having honed decision making skills through games.  And also in a sort of – and so I think games have kept my reflexes extremely fast as well.  I do play some kind of reflex heavy games quite competitively as well as strategic games, and in those cases I think that has definitely kept my reactions sharp and that type of thing.  
Respondent 9: I think it was at a conference a while back – this was quite funny – someone knocked a glass off a table and I went woo, and caught it, on the way down.  And this was kind of right in the middle of when I was playing a lot of really, really incredibly fast reflex heavy games.  And all the people I was with then said, well, that’s the arcade games paying off there.  Whether that’s true or not, I definitely think games have done a lot for me in terms of making good choices in life and in terms of just keeping my brain and my eyes and my hands quite sharp.
Interviewer: Do you think that games can be addictive?
Respondent 9: I think that’s absolute nonsense in my opinion.  I think all kind of models of – in general I think addiction models in psychology in general are tremendously flawed and written through with a lot of implicit ideological assumptions about how people should spend their leisure time and some very condescending opinions on the extent to which one has free will and the extent to which one should be allowed to go in one’s own time and things of that sort.
Respondent 9: To an extent I think anything can be addictive, but if games are addictive then to me personally I think the fault, in so far as there is fault, I don’t think – let me think a second how to word this.  The “fault” definitely doesn’t lie with the game, it lies with an addictive personality on the part of the person in question. Which I am not saying is their fault at all, but it’s definitely not the game’s fault.  And I think it’s extremely easy clearly when we’ve had a lot of kind of moral panics around games for the newest one to be, oh games can cause addiction and get you trapped inside and you never go out and you never engage with people and you never go to school and you never work and blah, blah, blah.  But anything can do that.  
Respondent 9: And things that are healthy for most people, like you could get addicted to TV and I think that you could argue that a lot of people are in fact.  But I think games make a very easy target and I think placing the responsibility or placing the agency at least on games rather than on the individual and on the kind of wider social context in which the individual has been raised and has been socialised I think is a big mistake.
Interviewer: You are in a very interesting position on the topic of addiction, because it’s widely debated whether games or addictive or not.  And there are several voices in academic research for or against this kind of position.  But when games are presented as addictive there is often this comparison with gambling, which is much more recognised as an addiction with potential detrimental effects.  And it’s interesting because actually you are a gambler online as well, so you have both of these – an experience with a kind of behaviour that is much more often conceptualised as problematic.  But I gather you don’t perceive it that way.
Respondent 9: Well, without a doubt, no.  I mean, I made a long-term income, I never—
Interviewer: You said you see the problem in gambling more as part of the individual, the problem with addiction in the individual rather than the activity?
Respondent 9: Only in the sense that an individual is a product of a society/childhood/context/whatever which has raised someone in a way that they can't control how they wind up gambling.  And by that I mean I very much break with traditional psychological approaches of addiction which placed the blame solely on the person.  I do not feel the blame lies with the media product, but the blame – well, I don’t think blame is the right word.  I think responsibility or agency are the better words, and those lie – it’s the individual who can't act in a responsible way but the only reason they can't is not an internal flaw or some moral weakness or this type of thing.  It’s as a result of the social context which have created that person.
Respondent 9: I think in terms of addiction might be from gambling games, again, most people will gamble with no long-term harm.  There are lots of people like me who make full-time incomes, who make steady, regular incomes from “gambling games”.  Clearly those people aren’t harmed.  For me it did nothing but good.  It made me money, it was a career path I would have enjoyed.  I met a bunch of cool people and they taught me a lot about how to live and life and things of this sort.  
Respondent 9: So I think putting the agency on the tool I think is a huge mistake, and putting the agency on the person is also a huge mistake.  The agency comes from the social context which in turn then creates the person who can't control their impulses or balance their life in a healthy way.  And also just to go off the transcript for one second, can I look over the transcript before it goes out?  I just want to make sure that I just said what I wanted to on the record?
Interviewer: Just to be sure, sorry?
Respondent 9: Will it be able to look over the transcript before it goes public?
Interviewer: Well, we didn’t plan for that.
Respondent 9: I would like to if that’s okay.
Interviewer: Okay.  I will make a note of that.  
Respondent 9: Just since addiction is a fairly contentious topic and I just want to make sure what I want to go on record basically, even if it is anonymised.  Great, thank you.  
Interviewer: Last topic I’d like to touch on in this theme is physical activity.  Do you feel games – you already said a little about reflexes which are some kind of physical benefit you had from playing games.  But do you think games impacted your physical health?
Respondent 9: That’s an interesting one.  A little bit, yeah.  Games definitely damaged my posture a little bit.  I’ve mostly improved that back to what it should be now but it’s been a long and slow process.  Up until I was about twenty or so I never did any exercise in my entire life except for what school forced me to do.  I don’t think that was related to games.  My hate of exercise and my love of games I don’t feel were related.  But in the last seven or eight years I’ve become far more physically active, I do lots of running, I spend lots of time at the gym, I go hiking.  And that I don’t feel – personally although the cliché is clearly for the kind of unfit gaming nerd, I personally don’t think there’s any relationship between my lack of enjoyment and then my lack of enjoyment of physical activity and games.  Those are two kind of different trends in my life I think.
Respondent 9: In general though, do games influence physical activity negatively or positively?  Clearly things like Just Dance will be positive. Most games, I don’t have enough data on whether there’s a causal relationship between games and physical activity to comment.  For me I don’t feel there was any relationship there, the reason I disliked and then liked exercise had nothing to do with games in my view.
Interviewer: Thank you.  Moving on, the third thing to touch are I will say practical application of video games.  You said you had a lot of benefits from playing games.  Do you think games can be used for a purpose other than pure entertainment, these or other kind of benefits?
Respondent 9: Definitely.  But for the big caveat which is that I think things like – things which explicitly label themselves as being educational games and so forth, there’s a reason that no one buys those and that’s because they label themselves in that way.  And when I look at games like – when I look at historical games like Civilization or the [Europa Universalis 0:23:54] series, or the Crusader King series, I think those teach players a tremendous amount about the past but they do so in the background to game play.  I think labelling a game as something which is designed to be educational and wholesome and things of this sort, I think that’s a real mistake and that turns people off.  
Respondent 9: And I think that there’s a reason why no educaotinl game in history has ever reached the top of the charts or got top reviews or this type of thing.  Because no one likes to be almost to be preached to I think in a way.  There’s something a little bit preachy about those kinds of games, about this idea that peoples’ leisure time should be explicitly coopted into something productive and something useful rather than just accepting that leisure is useful in its own right.
Respondent 9: So to me I think games like those which implicitly and tacitly teach players things are great.  I think games which are explicitly educational games in some ways I don’t think they are even really games, they are more like interactive learning simulations or something.  And then in terms of physical benefit, yeah, games can definitely improve one’s thinking, improve one’s reflexes.  Improve one’s physical fitness if it’s something like Just Dance or other games where you have to stand up and move around and things, those sort are quite rare.  
Interviewer: You did have a practical aplciatoin of video games, which is using them to earn money, but – how would I say it?  Did you play specifically for earning money or was that a side benefit of what was an entertaining pastime activity for you?
Respondent 9: When I started playing poker my single objective was to become good enough to make an income from it.  I really enjoyed it and it was really fun and challenging and deep and complex and all these good things.  But my core objective was to become good enough to make a living from playing it without a doubt.  Yeah.  And clearly one can earn a living is one streams on Twitch or if one’s on eSports players and things of this sort. But on the other hand something like League of Legends has a hundred million players and something like five hundred professionals or something.  So it’s absolutely a tiny, tiny apex of people who can make a living from doing this.  Clearly most of those who try to make a living and then fail will have “wasted that time” which trhey could have spent on something else.  So although one can earn with games there’s still very few ways to make money or to even make a living from playing games.  And those which do exist tend to be egxtremely competitive and extreamly demanding.
Interviewer: So you didn’t earn money when playing competitively, was it Red Alert 2?
Respondent 9: No, I earned no money from that at all.  There was no kind of economic ecosystem around it, no.
Interviewer: Another thing I would like to ask you, do you know gamification as a concept?
Respondent 9: Oh yes.
Interviewer: I imagined as much.  Do you have any experience with gamified systems?
Respondent 9: Well, I am very strongly opposed to gamification.  I think it’s a very – for two reasons.  Firstly gamification I think is something of a misnomer.  If say you have a system which tracks how much work you do each day and then you get points or trophies for doing more work, that’s not a game, that’s making people work harder in traditional neoliberal labour. And that’s not in fact a game and that’s not playful.  
Respondent 9: The secod issue with it is just that.  Gamification is designed to make people do what they don’t want to do by deploying psychological tricks and pretending it’s all fun and playful where it’s in fact quite the reverse I’d say.  And a third issue I guess with gamification is this kind of – this incredibly naïve philosophical claim that the world can be made better by just making it more fun and having more play and making it more game like.  
Respondent 9: And it blows my mind that anyone can have such a simplistic model of the world to think that would sovle peoples’ problems.  But that seems very strong throughout the gamification literature in general.  That kind of perspective immediately closes on any kind of serious analysis of social inequalities or of labour processes or of work, employment contracts, precariousness, etcetera.
Respondent 9: I don’t dispute that gamification can – well, if gamification was something else, if gamification was a genuine kind of making playful that which is not playfurl, I think that would be far more desirable.  But inherently that would be something far more anarchic and far more subversive.  Whereas gamification right now is basically completely complicit in neoliberal capitalism and therefore I’m not a big fan.
Interviewer: I personally can’t think of an example of gamification made for making something really enjoyable. (Laughs)
Respondent 9: Likewise, yeah.
Interviewer: It is an application, a practical application of game elements.  Is there anything you want to add here?  Or shall we move on to the next thing?
Respondent 9: I guess just a brief comment on serious games.  I also think serious games are a bit of a misnomer again.  Again, I don’t think they are really games as such.  I think they are interactive simulations or they are something of that sort.  But I think that that use of the word game doesn’t really fit in there because they lack the kind of playfulness which I’d say is crucial to what a game is.
Interviewer: The next question is whether you see any sort of ethical issues in the use of games?  Some you already talked about, for example, about gamification (laughs) [ethics predation 0:31:24] I would say.
Respondent 9: Mm-hmm.
Interviewer: So ethical issues both in the use of games and in the message they convey?
Respondent 9: Yeah.  Well, hmm…  I think gamification stands out as my biggest issue in this kind of area.  Outside of that though I think there are some big ethical issues around the depiction of contemporary events, like recent invasions of the Middle East and things of this sort.  Clearly a lot of games portray the ongoing conflict.  I think it’s important to think about how games portray those and how people are therefore encouraged to think about those conflicts.  
Respondent 9: I think games do have a certain ethical responsibility as well when they portray the very distant past or when they portray archaeology.  I think there’s a certain ethical requirement to at least try to engage with the current academic understanding of those eras, even if that means adding more kind of world building complexity than maybe the developers would like to.
Interviewer: May I ask you, are you thinking of specific games when you’re saying this kind of problem?
Respondent 9: Not immediately, no.  But in the first case I’m thinking about a lot of first person shooters and this type of thing.  In the second case, a bunch of games but generally more indie games rather than AAA games.  And then I guess another ethical issue is how free ot play games and not free to play games encourage players to give more money, I think it’s a pretty gigantic issue.  I think the monetisation of game platforms and the psychological tricks used to encourage people to pay more, I think that’s a pretty huge ethical issue.
Respondent 9: Again, I think some responsibility lies with the game system, some responsibility lies with the individual, some responsibility lies with the society that conditioned the individual.  But I think that’s definitely a pretty big ethical issue for games I think.
Interviewer: Monetisation was actually something we were thinking about.  You don’t play free to play games?
Respondent 9: I don’t.  I don’t think I’ve ever played a free to play game, no.
Interviewer: Because you don’t like them or is that a personal stance?
Respondent 9: I don’t think there’s a single free to play game that’s worth my time, to be completely frank.  I can't think of one that I feel would be worth the time I would put into it.  Yeah.
Interviewer: Another problem you cited was the depiction of military conflicts.  The issue we were thinking about which is also related with that is depiction of other races or…
Respondent 9: Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: …gender roles.
Respondent 9: Yes.  I would definitely include those.  I think those two are extremely important.  Especially as the demographics of gamers are no longer even remotely just white men.  I think games have got to recognise that now and start changing pretty substantially.  I think that there’s a lot of games which do great stuff in this kind of area.  A lot of games which are somewhat less great, but I think overall I would say the industry is getting a little bit better at doing that, yeah.
Respondent 9: And then to briefly comment on inclusion and piracy.  I guess inclusion just goes within what I said.  Piracy I think is a super, super complex issue which is way beyond what I could say here.  Basically I think I don’t think I’ve ever pirated a game, if I have then I’ve wiped it from my memory, but I don’t think I have ever.  But I don’t think piracy is colossally moral, I think it’s very contextual.  I think there’s a lot of factors that add up to whether piracy should be considered ethically okay or not.  
Respondent 9: For instance, I read a great paper a while back about gamers in – I don’t remember what country, in a South American country I think – who have minimal access to traditional ways of buying games.  When they pirate the paper argued I think they are not taking money away from the game because the game would have never got money from them because they couldn’t buy the game.  But in having pirated the game if they like the game, if they like the genre, if they like the game dev etcetera, then in the future when more games of that type come out and those might be available for purchase, having pirated and then enjoyed one game which didn’t take any money from the dev, they might then be able to buy a later game.
Respondent 9: So I think examples like that are pretty crucial for thinking about priacy.  And for thinking about it not as some kind of binary, yes, no, good, evil type thing but as something which is highly contextual on how the labour process and how the economics and how the global distribution of games functions right now, and the access people have to games and how people want to play games and what context people want to play games in.  I think all those are crucial on how we should think about piracy.
Interviewer: In a way it’s also related to monetisation, because I mean, some kind of for example subscription models could be implemented to get around the problem of piracy for classic [pay to get it 0:37:54] games.
Respondent 9: Yeah.
Interviewer: Another thing I would like to talk about is the depiction of violence in games.  Because of course that’s also very widely debated, both in how it’s portrayed by itself and also in whether or not it can increase aggression in people. 
Respondent 9: Well, my feelings on this one are quite strong.  I think violence is completely fine in games as it is in any media format.  And if someone plays a bunch of violent games and then goes out and kills someone they would have done that if they watched films, if they’d read books, if they’d gone to the theatre, if they’d had any contact with violence anywhere.  Again, blaming the game is just completely absurd there, it’s just a lot of that kind of moral panic.  If there’s any link between games and aggression, which in no way I’m convinced by, then I think that the positive side to games still colossally outweigh those downsides.
Interviewer: I have a question on my mind, maybe I’m misinterpreting something you said.  Because both when we were talking about gambling and when we were talking about violence you saw the fault I would say of the problem not in the game but in the context of the player, yeah, the wider social context.  But when we are talking about free to play games and the gamification you placed quite a bit of blame on the system.
Respondent 9: Yes, this is true.
Interviewer: So I feel you are treating these kind of issues differently, is that right?
Respondent 9: Hmm.  Yeah, that probably is true I think, yeah.  I think a certain degree of the blame, of the responsibility for gamification, does lie with systems, how they are implemented.  But I think violence is very different.  Because gamification systems are trying to make someone do a certain thing, violent games are not trying to make people violent.  And I think that’s a pretty crucial difference actually.  I think in terms of violence, in terms of game violence affecting people being the question that’s outside the game itself, if I can use myself as an example, I can't think of how many heads I’ve blown up in games, I can't think how many people I’ve killed.  But in my real life I’ve never been in a fight, I’m a vegan, I make sure not to step on insects.  I’m the most peaceful pacifistic human on earth.  And there’s conceivable way that violent games would have shaped me to become more hostile in real life.  But if it does then that’s not on the game in any way, shape or form I think. 
Interviewer: Thank you.  Moving on towards the end of the interview, this is the most abstract question I would say (laughs) which is about the relationship between games and society.  Do you believe games influence society and if so, how?
Respondent 9: Oh definitely.  I think society’s influence on games is probably stronger than games’ influence on society right now at least.  But I think historically there’s so many ways we can see how games shaped society.  Looking at things like the Go academies in medieval Japan or looking at chess in the Cold War and things of this sort, I think can see extremely strong ways where games and how people thought about those games and thought about the people who played those games affected back on wider social life.
Respondent 9: These days I think games are – well, games have offered people a new and tremendously enjoyable form of leisure.  Games have pushed a lot of industries forward, games have pushed a lot of artistic practices forward I would say.  Games have I would say have had a hugely positive effect in terms of forming new relationships for people, new friendships.  There are clearly people who have got married to people who they met in games.  Like I say, I think games do teach people a lot of very desirable things.  Yeah.
Interviewer: I would like to probe a little more what you said about the relationship between art and games.  You said – if I remember the exact words you used, they push artistic practices.
Respondent 9: Yes.
Interviewer: Do you believe games can be art then?
Respondent 9: Of course, every game ever made is – well, every game is an artistic work just as every novel is an artistic work.  But as for how many games are worthy of being classed as high art or something I think the number’s quite low.  But I think the number of films is quite low and the number of books is quite low and the number of theatre performances is quite low and the number of ballets is quite low.  I think if you look at every single thing ever performed or written within a genre, I think inevitably most of it is going to be garbage at the end of the day I would say.  It’s still an artistic work since it’s a piece of media produced within a certain art form, within a certain artistic practice.  
Respondent 9: But the quality will vary hugely within any art form.  I mean, games have produced a game like Dark Souls and games have also produced Custer’s Last Stand, which might be the most despicable piece of garbage ever created in the lifetime of games.  And one of those is art, the other is a piece of media, a piece of artistic work, but it’s not high art.  So yes, I don’t think more games or fewer games are “art” than films or TV or literature or whatever.  But I think definitely – in some ways I think what would mark out a game as being worthy of the “art” label is perhaps broader than something like film or literature.  
Respondent 9: Because you can do more with games in some ways I would argue, because you can do more, you can have more kinds of interactions between the player and the game can be I would argue more experimental than in almost any other media form.  I think the breadth of what could be counted as high art in games is broader than in say cinema, I would argue.  But that would be a fairly contentious claim I think, but that’s what I would say anyway.
Interviewer: Can you think of a few games you consider art?
Respondent 9: Okay, so I would say Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne I think are two of the absolute pinnacles of the game art form.  In terms of game play, in terms of narrative, in terms of they are so thematically dense.  They are in conversation with so many other games, with so many ideas, with so many mythologies, with so much literature.  Visually they are just beyond stunning.  And I don’t mean that in terms of the graphical fidelity, I mean that in terms of the artistic quality of what’s shown on screen.  So to me, those are two of the absolute pinnacles of what games have been so far.
Respondent 9: I guess I would also give extremely high praise to – let me think a second… I would also give extremely high praise to the original Command and Conquer from 1995.  It’s slightly overlooked these days, but again it’s remarkably thematically deep, it has an amazing prediction of the last twenty years and the conflict between the West and this kind of nebulous anti-Western group or a group that is perceived as being such.  The story told and the world depicted is hugely deep and hugely dense.  The game in general has no kind of gaps and no holes and there’s nothing missing from it.  It’s a very complete and very kind of singular piece of work.
Respondent 9: I will just try and think of one more.  Let me just look at my Steam list to jog my memory about what games I in fact like.  Oh yes.  I guess another would be EVE online actually.  It’s so unique, it’s so different.  It’s so – again, much like Dark Souls and like Bloodborne and like Command and Conquer, it’s so singular, it has a single core concept which is completely unique and takes that concept to its full completion.  And does everything with that concept you could possibly do and exhausts that concept.  
Respondent 9: And I guess a fifth I would mention would be Dwarf Fortress.  Which again I think takes a concept and runs with it as far as it can go, and is so unique and so idiosyncratic.  And the interactions which take place in that game are so unlike anything in any other game ever.  And I think Dwarf Fortress – which the Museum of Modern Art in New York listed as one of its top art games a few years ago, I think Dwarf Fortress is also a great example.
Respondent 9: And I suppose the commonality in all those to use a cinematic term, these are all kind of high concept games I guess in some ways.  Where they have a single core completely unique concept and they take that to its total limit and completely embody the space of what that game might be.  I guess those are some of the games I’d say which are the absolute highest outcomes of the forms of art.
Interviewer: What I find interesting is that all these games you are referencing are very much entertainment games.  Entertainment is still forefront, because—
Respondent 9: I don’t know if I agree with that.  I don’t know if I would actually agree with that.  Do you mean as opposed to – opposed to what?
Interviewer: Because here I’m speaking of my experience, personally, I can think of a few titles which have a more purely artistic intent.
Respondent 9: Are you thinking of things like Journey or Flow and those sorts of games?
Interviewer: Yeah, Journey for example, yes.  Flow I don’t know about.  And those are games in which game play is not really the focus I would say, it is a component but not the focus.  I would consider the games you cited, I mean, Command and Conquer for example, the game play is central…
Respondent 9: Yeah.
Interviewer: …and then there is this world around it.
Respondent 9: I think the best – yeah, that’s true.  To me, I think the best games manage to be incredibly deep and complex games but also to be deeply meaningful and deeply rich and to have a lot of thematic content and to have a lot of artistic ideas alongside that.  To me, although I have nothing against things like Journey, to me those completely hit all the artistic marks but they don’t really hit too many of the game marks for me.  Whereas the five games I listed get a ten out of ten on the artistic front and a ten out of ten on the game front as well.  To me that’s the real apex of what games could be I think.  
Interviewer: Okay, thank you.  What do you think about how games are marketed?
Respondent 9: That’s a very big question, can you narrow that down a little bit?
Interviewer: (Laughs)
Respondent 9: Okay, that’s fine.  I think games are definitely still marketed in a way that assumes all gamers are white men for one thing, which is very negative and undesirable.  Game marketing also tends to – well, it tends to hype games up far beyond what they turn out to be in the end.  I think it would be harder to dispute that looking at some recent examples which I won't name, mainly because I’m friends with other people who worked on them. 
Respondent 9: I think there’s definitely – the divide between the setting up of expectations in players and the delivery of the game itself I think is a big issue.  And there’s no fault or no malice on the game devs.  I know that people don’t mean to mislead players.  But the games industry has reached a point I think in terms of marketing where one has to hype one’s game up so much that it becomes harder for the game to truly deliver in the end.  In a similar vein, I think if we look at game reviewing, a lot of people have noted that seven out of ten is the new average in some ways.  And that when people see a five out of ten they think, oh this game is shit.  Rather than, oh this game is average, because that’s what a five should be.  It should be exactly average game.
Respondent 9: And this kind of constant pushing towards the top and everything has to be defined within being the absolute best and marketed as being the best and the reviews have to kind of push upwards in order to sell these types of games and to describe what these games are doing, I think all of that is a big problem.  And I’m not sure what exactly the way out of it is.  But it’s definitely a problem.
Interviewer: The last thing I would like to talk about is innovation in games since you have been a player for a very long time, so you probably saw quite a bit of innovation.  Recently there has also been quite a bit of talk around VR or augmented reality as a possible way of making games.  So again, it’s kind of a broad question (laughs).
Respondent 9: That’s fine.  Yeah, there’s definitely been a lot of innovative stuff in the last twenty years.  In many ways – in almost all ways I think it’s indie developers now who are doing the really cool, new, fresh stuff.  There are “huge play” companies who are doing really cool stuff.  I think FromSoftware who make Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I think they are probably the most original AAA developer around right now by quite a margin.
Respondent 9: But I think most innovation right now comes from indies who are willing to try whacky new things.  Indeed in the game I make, I’m trying to make something which no one’s done ever before and maybe it’ll crash and burn but maybe it’ll work out well, who knows.  Either way I think that’s something worth doing.  In the AAA space though, I think there’s very little new happening outside of a tiny handful of companies such as FromSoftware.  Yeah.
Interviewer: How would you see the future of video games, if you had to hazard a guess?
Respondent 9: Yeah, so in terms of VR and AR and things, I guess overall to me the four kind of really big new trends in games right now are eSports, livestream, VR and AR, personally.  To me, I remain unconvinced by both VR and AR personally.  Now, I must acknowledge my bias here with this answer, which is that my focus of research as an academic for the last year and a half has been solely on eSports and livestreaming, not on VR and AR, so I know more on those topics than on VR and AR.  So I should acknowledge that.  
Respondent 9: But I think AR, it’s tricky to see – I think the issue with VR and AR is an interface issue.  That with both of them you’re adding a layer of interface, it feels like one’s adding a kind of obstacle between the player and the game in some ways.  AR, you need the alignment of the player, of some kind of console, and some physical object and you have to keep them within a certain alignment for things to work perfectly.  It’s not that that’s extremely demanding, but it still requires a level of maintenance that lots of types of play don’t.
Respondent 9: And then VR, on the one hand I can see a future where people are willing to do the headset and goggles and gloves and things in order to have that kind of full William Gibson style emersion within the game.  On the other hand I can see a future where people say, sod this, this is way too much effort, I’d rather just go and play Bejewelled on my phone.  Again, with VR, because it requires extra effort from the player it’s another layer of stuff to deal with.  I’m not convinced where that will go.  
Respondent 9: Again, I think there’s also an issue with both VR and AR which is that controllers and keyboards are extremely good ways of allowing players to do a lot of inputs across a wide range of things extremely quickly.  VR and AR, again, it’s kind of hard to see what will input systems look like here, how can you create games which – and clearly not all games require really deep and complex input systems, but a lot of games do.  All games require input systems where you can act with precision even if the system itself is quite simple.  And for both VR and AR it’s kind of tricky to see how you can get that kind of precision or that kind of complexity in input systems for either one.  Again, maybe I’m completely wrong, but those are my concerns about VR and AR.
Respondent 9: By contrast, for eSports and streaming, I mean, the reason I decided to focus my study on them is because I think those are the future.  I think eSports is only getting bigger, like a hundred million dollars in prize money was given out last year, that’s completely bananas.  And I think it will only continue to grow from there.  I think it’s something people want to watch, it’s found a good way to engage the viewer to make a link between what the viewer watches and the viewer’s own playing practice in CS:GO, in League, in Dota, in whatever.  
Respondent 9: Streaming is even more popular.  Two million people stream each month and hundreds of millions of people watch.  It’s come from almost nowhere within five years to become a completely ubiquitous part of gaming I’d say.  And maybe it’ll be a bubble, of course, these things do happen.  But I think streaming has taken a desire that people have always had to watch other people playing games from the era of the arcades up until now and transform that into something bigger and more formal.  Not in a bad sense, but more formalised and more present and more there.  
Respondent 9: Also of course streaming – like I said at the start, with the conflict between peoples’ lives being increasingly dominated by work but with more and more games which come out each year, streaming allows people to vicariously enjoy games without necessarily having the time to play them, which I think is also very—
Interviewer: As long as you watch videos at work.
Respondent 9: Or when you’re doing something else for fun.  Like you play one game but you watch another in the background.  So those types of things.  I think streaming and Twitch specifically has come along at a perfect time and has hit a pretty strong nerve.  So yeah, I think eSports and streaming I definitely think are the future, but then like I say, I acknowledge my bias there.  But VR and AR I’m willing to be proven wrong but I’m not convinced yet that either of those will be the future beyond small niches.  Or if they are, I think both will have to offer something which is so compelling that it gets past the kind of gimmick factor in some ways.
Interviewer: Let us talk a little more about eSports and livestream, because it’s something that has been really rarely touched upon by our interviewees, so I’d like to take advantage of your expertise (laughs).   How do you think they evolved?  I mean, is livestreaming now different from how it was in the beginning apart from the sheer volume of it?
Respondent 9: Oh yes.  Livestreaming when it started you could livestream basically anything at all.  And that as you can imagine ran into certain problems and certain issues with some things people chose to livestream.  But it was only when Twitch became focussed on games specifically that livestreaming exploded.  I think that that’s – streaming in general definitely speaks to our broader desire either to be celebrities or to watch and actively engage with celebrities.  I think those two desires are clearly very strongly reflected in streaming and on streaming.
Respondent 9: Twitch has recently released IRL which is the in real life category, and they’ve kind of returned a little bit to livestreaming roots by allowing people to livestream anything, or almost anything.  It’ll be interesting to see where that goes and whether that will kind of dilute the platform or just continue to grow it by letting people watch people eating in cafés or on the bus or whatever it is people do in their lives.  Yeah, so livestreaming has definitely evolved quite a bit.  
Respondent 9: And also a course a lot of this evolution has been through monetising the platform and making sure that both streamers can make a living and the platform itself can continue to make money and grow and so forth.  It’ll be interesting to see where that goes in the future as Twitch is very active and very – well, yeah, Twitch is very active in innovating and finding new ways to monetise the platform and to build a sense of community on the platform, and seeing where that goes in the next few years I think will be very interesting.
Interviewer: How about eSports?
Respondent 9: eSports has gone through a bunch of ups and downs and a bunch of points where people thought, right, this is it, eSports is here and then dies, then comes back up, then dies, and so forth. To me both eSports and livestreaming, not to be technologically determinist about this, but eSports and livestreaming are both significantly contingent on modern internet speeds basically.  Because you need that to play against people and you need that to watch other people playing games basically.  So to an extent I think both of them could only have appeared within the last five years where within North America, within Europe, within East Asia, within Australia, where internet speeds are so fast that you can do these things at a high level and watch these things in high quality streamed videos.
Respondent 9: And also at the same time I think one – so eSports found its recent success because of Twitch, because Twitch allows it to reach millions of people and it does.  But also it’s also interwoven with the success of games like CS:GO and League and Dota and Overwatch [Halston 1:05:03].  But then also the success of those games is woven in with eSports and streaming.  So there’s a complex kind of conference of factors of games, of what players want to play, what players want to watch, of both streaming technology and of internet speed in general.  And these have all kind of come together at this point to allow eSports to become what it is now.  And I think it’s extremely unlikely that we are in an eSports bubble right now.  I think eSports from this point onwards will only continue to grow.
Interviewer: Something I was thinking about when you were talking about the complex relationship within games and eSports is that in a way eSports – well, games in general, but eSports especially need a community around them.
Respondent 9: Hmm, definitely.  
Interviewer: There is something we have not touched on the in the interview, the community of gamers, the communities of gamers.  What do you feel about them?
Respondent 9: That’s a big question.
Interviewer: I mean, you said you met a lot of interesting people and a lot of new friends from playing, I don’t know if you have ever been part of the community or felt part of a community around games?
Respondent 9: Hmm, well, right now – I don’t know if you’ve come across roguelike games?
Interviewer: Yeah.
Respondent 9: Right now without being arrogant, I’m definitely one of the ten biggest people in the roguelike community I think, in the world.  Because the game I make is roguelike, I’m a big part of the main roguelike podcasts, I do a lot of writing about roguelikes for magazines and stuff.  And that’s the only community I felt really a big part of ever really.  It’s a lovely community of lovely people, in general, with one or two exceptions, who I will not name but they know who they are.  
Respondent 9: In general I’d say everyone is very nice, is very supportive, is very smart, is very interested in games.  And the poker community I was never a big part of the poker community, I was pretty active on the big poker forum back in the day but never really became a big part of the community.  Partly because I lived in the UK rather than in the US and in that era at least poker was so heavily focussed on the US that it was hard to be someone who didn’t live in the US and to be a real part of that world.  
Respondent 9: So from both roguelikes and from poker I’ve seen gaming communities which are incredibly just composed of amazing, smart, nice people.  But at the same clearly gamergate also exists within games and that is the exact opposite.  I’ve never really have much direct encounter with those kinds of people, thank goodness, but I do know that they exist.  I think gaming, there’s so much variation between what genre you play and what people within that genre you engage with, it’s impossible to make any sweeping comment about gamers or gaming communities I think.  Some are amazingly inclusive, friendly, smart, cool people who I still have friendships with.  And others are incredibly toxic people.
Interviewer: I’m a little, well, not surprised, but something that came up in all interviews with gamers I conducted, I mean, when we talked about the gaming community everyone has something bad to say about online interactions.  I don’t know if it’s the different kind of games they played.  So if some games are a worse community, if it’s something in how they interpret some kind of interactions.  Or even if it’s something in how communities are regulated.  So maybe some games attract more toxic player I would say, or maybe it’s not that at all and it’s just a matter of how the community is managed.  I don’t know if you have any opinion about that from your experience?
Respondent 9: I think there’s definitely a genre difference.  But it’s also a question of how the community is structured due to the nature of the game.  Roguelikes are purely single player games for instance and that means you never have kind of live online chats in the middle of a game where players are competing with each other.  You only talk on Reddit or on Twitter basically, or on like forums and things.  And I think that’s a pretty gigantic difference to be honest in the context where people are engaging with other people.
Respondent 9: At the same time there’s definitely a question of community management to an extent.  But I can't think of a game community offhand which I know about I can see a difference between a well managed and a poorly managed community.  On the other hand, maybe that’s because when the community is well managed you don’t see that it’s well managed and that all management is kind of hidden and maybe that’s true.  But to me, I think the bigger issue is what’s the relationship between the social interactions and the play of the game, I think is a bigger issue than how a community is managed personally.
Interviewer: So you think it’s a problem of the context of interaction?
Respondent 9: Yeah.
Interviewer: Live online interaction in a competitive game?
Respondent 9: But I do also think genre of game does also matter somewhat as well.
Interviewer: Moving on to the last section of the interview, I mean, we talked about possible advantages, opportunities of games, but not so much about problems because you have a very positive outlook on games.
Respondent 9: Mostly.
Interviewer: I would like to ask what kind of advice you would give to different kind of people when interacting with games to make this better or even better?
Respondent 9: To developers I’d say try new things and – well, I think that’s the most important by a huge margin.  Try new things, don’t be afraid to try new things, and please be realistic about the promises you make about your games.  To parents, I’d say understand that games are not toxic and the game’s not evil and the games will not ruin your children’s lives.  There’s a tremendous amount of career opportunities in games these days as a developer, as a tester, as an artist, as a sound designer, as a player, as a streamer.  And also even if your child doesn’t take those kind of routes games still teach you a lot about competition, about cooperation, they train your reflexes, they train your decision making. 
Respondent 9: To researchers I’d say look more closely at the social context of games.   Look more closely at the whole skill and ability and interface and interaction in games, which is something reasonably overlooked in games academia I think.  There’s been a lot of great work in this already but I still feel it’s an area we need to look at more deeply.  To educators I’d say stop making educational games immediately.  Make games which happen to teach you, not educational games, and there’s a huge difference – there’s a gulf of difference between those two kinds of games.
Respondent 9: To players I’d say try to be less toxic.  To institutions, what do you think about in terms of institutions, do you mean governments or—
Interviewer: Yes, for example.
Respondent 9: I’d say recognise the huge benefits that games can bring.  And I think that’s the only thing really I’d say, that’s kind of an echo of what I’d say to people who count I think.
Interviewer: Okay.  Is there something you want to add that we didn’t touch on?
Respondent 9: Let me think a minute… 
Interviewer: Of course.
Respondent 9: I don’t think so, no.  
Interviewer: Okay.  I guess that’s it then. 

Interview 10:
Interviewer: I will explain to you how this interview works.  As I said in my initial email, we are interested in your experience with games and what you think about games in general.  We will start from your experiences and then cover a variety of topics, and these slides I'm sharing have some keywords which you can use to guide your thoughts.  You're not required to use them and touch upon all these topics.  You can just use them to help you.  Okay?
Respondent 10: Okay.
Interviewer: Okay, great.  Do you have any questions about the interview?
Respondent 10: No.  It sounds good.
Interviewer: Okay, great.  I think I'm hearing you with a little bit of delay, so don't worry if I'm (laughs) a little slow in answering you.  Okay?
Respondent 10: Okay.  Is that going to be all right with the delay?
Interviewer: Yeah, yeah.  So we can begin the interview by talking about your experience with games.  So, which games do you play, how long do you usually play, etcetera?
Respondent 10: Okay.  Are you interested in hearing about how games came into my life other than playing them, because I'm a developer as well?
Interviewer: Yes, I am interested in that.
Respondent 10: Or is more about playing?
Interviewer: We will focus on your experience as a player, but yes, I am also interested in how you interact with games in general.
Respondent 10: Okay.
Interviewer: So how did you come in contact with games?
Respondent 10: Okay.  So when I was younger, I used to play games with my dad, and we only had a Mac when I was a kid, so we didn't have any handheld consoles or home console systems or anything.  So my first experience with games was games like Mist (laughs), which is quite unusual, I think, for a first game.  
Respondent 10: So when I was first introduced to them – and my parents were quite interested in games as an artistic medium as well –I was introduced to them as, basically, other worlds that you could experience.  So I was always interested in games that were very sort of story-based or ones where you could just go to this complete other world that somebody has created.
Respondent 10: For me, for a long time it was kind of a thing I did alone.  So I didn't have many other friends growing up who played games or were interested in playing games, and definitely my sister was not, so it was quite a solitary thing.  After I got past the age of about ten, I stopped playing games with my dad and just played them on my own.
Respondent 10: So I got more interested in games like Black and White, the Lionhead game.
Interviewer: Yeah, I know about it.
Respondent 10: Yeah?  So that was one of the ones where that was a real turning point for me.  I used to play that game all the time (laughs).  So it would be like the whole weekend, if I was able to.  It would be most of the time and I think I played it for several years as well.  So that was one where… that's kind of like a God game, so it's very much about kind of experimenting and like a sort of Sandbox most of the time.  So that really hooked me and I do like the kind of creational aspect of those kinds of world-building games.  I still do.  I still look for games like that really.
Respondent 10: The games I kind of play now are like Animal Crossing or some—  I've got access to other consoles now (laughs) so I have expanded in that department.  I have a 3DS and I have a Switch and I have access to a PC.  So, a few other games which I would've loved when I was younger, like Rollercoaster Tycoon or Civilisation and stuff, which I didn't have access to, have become more the games I would play now, now that I have access to more consoles as an adult with disposable income (laughs).
Interviewer: Do you play on a mobile too, a smartphone?
Respondent 10: I used to.  So, for a while I worked in an Apple store and I was there for the birth of the iPad.  So for a while I was very much aware of what was on the App Store, and I made a few apps, actually.  And then over the past year or so, I've moved away from mobile games and I don't play them so much.  I now prefer to play PC games and bigger games than mobile games.  
Respondent 10: So, if I was to play a game on a mobile, it would probably be one that is also available on PC.  So, slightly bigger games, like Kingdom is a good example of a mobile game which wasn't originally on mobile but has been put onto mobile, and that's one of my favourite games.
Interviewer: Yeah, I don't know it.
Respondent 10: Oh, it's an independent game.  It's like a sort of Pixelar game where you—  It's kind of a cross between roguelike and a tower defence and you're sort of building a little town, and then every night it gets attacked and you have to defend it.  It's very, very intuitive with very simple mechanics… well, simple controls.  So it was a really good mobile version.
Interviewer: Okay.  Do you still play mostly or exclusively alone?
Respondent 10: Not exclusively.  Since I have owned a few other consoles and I've got a lot more friends who play games, I've experienced a few multiplayer games, mostly local multiplayer.  Some of the best experiences I've had have been ones I just did not expect I would enjoy and then I've ended up really enjoying them (laughs).  Like I really enjoyed playing through Borderlands as a local co-op game, and that was a very, very unique experience for me.  I had never played an FPS or anything (laughs) like it.
Interviewer: Okay.  How much time do you play now, usually?
Respondent 10: Probably about four or five hours a week, and I'll just kind of do an hour in an evening or a few hours at the weekend.
Interviewer: Okay.  And if I may ask – you may choose not to answer (laughs) – how much do you spend on games?
Respondent 10: That has varied throughout my lifetime (laughs).  So, nowadays I think it's probably about… I buy probably one game every couple of months and it's probably in the region of £20 to £40.  It'll just depend on what the game is.  Some games I'm willing to spend up to £60 on, but that will probably be once a year.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, okay.  So moving on to the second section of this interview, I would like to ask you how do you feel games influence you.  I mean, you play games for a lot of time, do you feel they have any influence on you, and which kind of influence?
Respondent 10: Yeah, definitely.  I think it's always been something for me where it's an opportunity to get some alone time, so I used to seek it out as that kind of activity.  So I think when everything else is so kind of out of control (laughs), especially when you're a kid and you're at school, I think that was always the control aspect, something that was really appealing.  So, playing games was like a wi—  I used to also play a lot of The Sims, which you just have complete control over everything that's happening.  So that was kind of something I really liked about the games that I used to play, and I still do play games like that (laughs).
Respondent 10: So yeah, with games like Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, it's kind of just having a little space that's yours, and it's very nurturing and it's a space for me where I can go and do that.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  So like a relaxing pastime?
Respondent 10: Yeah.
Interviewer: Okay.  Any other kind of influence?  I'm showing you the keywords if you want to pick some of them.
Respondent 10: Collaboration is one that I have experienced a lot more recently.  So, playing a few local co-op games, but also things like Sandbox games with other people.  I'd never really done that before, and then one of the games that I ended up working on in the last couple of years is a sort of modding Sandbox game.  So that's been a really interesting experience and I've really enjoyed that.
Interviewer: Hmm.  One thing that is not amongst the keywords but you talked about is creativity.  You said you like this kind of element in games.  Do you think that games help you become more creative, even outside of the gaming space?
Respondent 10: Yeah, I think so.  I think that they're kind of a place where you can safely experiment with ideas you might have.  So it may not directly translate into your real life (laughs) but it's definitely somewhere you can kind of build those connections and experiment with things.  That could be in a social way because often the games I play have other characters that you speak to or that you need to become friends with and build relationships with, and I think that's an area where you can be quite experimental and it can really kind of help people to maybe expand that creativity.
Interviewer: Okay.  Do you think that games can be addictive?
Respondent 10: I've definitely experienced that to some degree myself.  So I think that some games definitely are and it's often when they've got a very tight loop of rewarding you for doing something specific and then you can kind of just keep doing it as much as you like and it's just continuously rewarding.  So I think they can be very addictive.
Respondent 10: I've definitely had times where I've just played the same game for an entire day, from waking up to going to bed, but I haven't done it so much since I've been working in a job, and I kind of don't let myself do that.  I would also not want to anymore.
Interviewer: Okay.  The last topic I would like to touch on in this area is about immersion, because I get the impression that it is quite important to you when you choose games because you said you like to enter other worlds and – I don't know – immerse yourself (laughs) in something that is different from your real life.  Right?
Respondent 10: Yeah.
Interviewer: What are the elements of games, drawing also from your experience as a developer as well as a player, what are the elements in games that you think help you immerse and have this feeling of entering another world?
Respondent 10: Hmm, so there's a few elements in games that I think create the immersion that I like.  So it's usually when the atmosphere of the game is pleasant.  So I think, personally, I go for things that are more… like the more time you put into it, the more of a pleasant place you will be in.  So it's kind of like you're inhabiting this world when you're playing the game.  So the more you put into it, the more beautiful it looks and the more kind of happy things are.  
Respondent 10: I think that's kind of mirrored in some of the games that we create as well.  So, definitely in some games, like world-building games or games where you're kind of renovating somewhere or helping a community that is fictional, I think there's a lot in those aspects which appeal to me personally.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, yeah.  So you used the word 'nurturing' before, so that's the kinds of things that draw you in, right?
Respondent 10: Yeah, definitely.
Interviewer: Okay.  Moving on to the third topic we'd like to explore, do you see a practical application of video games?  And by 'practical', I mean using games not just for entertainment but for other purposes.
Respondent 10: Yeah, I have thought about this quite a lot (laughs).  One of the things that has been really interesting in some of the games I've worked on very recently is that they had a focus on being able to mod the game.  So that was something where I had never really done any programming at all and some of the requirements of my job, because I'm more art-based or sort of in the creative area of the game development, we also are encouraged to input or implement our own facets and the things we create.  
Respondent 10: So, because of this focus on modding, it was kind of like an introduction to how you can actually change parts of the games and you don't have to be a programmer and you don't have to—  It's kind of like an entry level to that, so it was something where I could see that being very educational.  So it's something where we would really want people to experiment with modding and it's an easy way to try it for the first time.
Respondent 10: So I think that games definitely have the capacity to teach sort of a lot of the different disciplines of how games are made, but also lots of things outside of that.  I think they're very useful educational tools because of the way that they're so immersive and they guide you quite easily or you can test yourself using a game.  So I think that there have been a few mobile games which have been very good for learning specific things, like I used to use Duolingo quite a lot, which is the language learning app.
Interviewer: Okay.  I don't know about it, but okay (laughs).
Respondent 10: Oh, it's very clever because it's got a lot of gamification to it.  So it has things like you get scores on the small, little tasks that it asks you to do and it breaks it down really, really well and it focuses a lot on the repetition of doing things again and again to get a better score.  But that's also how you memorise the language, so I think that was a really good application of it.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  Do you think these kinds of games and applications could be used in schools too?
Respondent 10: Yes, definitely.  That's kind of what I was touching on with the example I gave of the games that we make, is that I have been into schools with them and shown children of most ages actually, kind of quite young to also university students, that even if they don't have any programming experience or, really, any game development experience at all, that they're able to change something about the game then and there and see that their change has an outcome.  Then they can start to understand how the game works and how the development works.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  I find it interesting that—
Respondent 10: I also think that—  Sorry.
Interviewer: Yeah, go on.  Go on (laughs).
Respondent 10: I was going to say that, on the other aspect of it – because that's just about teaching game making, basically – but I think that there is definitely a place for them for teaching the subjects that you would want to be teaching in a school.  So it's definitely something that could improve language lessons and science lessons.  You could make a game about any subject at all, so I think there is definitely room for that.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, okay.  I was saying before that it's interesting that the application you have for games has quite a lot to do with creativity again.  So, creating mods.  Yeah, it's a very creative moment, I guess (laughs).
Respondent 10: Yeah, I think that's just been my experience of it really.  I know that other people have learnt other subjects through games and I know that there are definitely some brilliant independent games that kind of tell you an untold story about a time in history.  Those are really, really brilliant because I think, otherwise, some of those stories just get lost.
Interviewer: Okay.  So, moving on, the next thing I would like to ask you is about ethical issues.  So do you see any kind of ethical issues in the use of games or in the messages they convey?
Respondent 10: Yeah, I think it's easy for me to focus on the kinds of games that I like (laughs) and ignore some of the others that come out, which I think do get picked up in the press about issues like this.  
Respondent 10: So I think there is definitely a focus a lot of the time on similar characters and not very much representation in, mostly, larger triple-A games.  But not always (laughs).  I think some studios are doing really great things with that, but yeah, I think representation is definitely one that, for many years, was just not very thought about.  And for me, it never really put me off the games when I was growing up, that there wasn't much diversity in the stories that were told or in the characters you could play as.  I was drawn to the game for other reasons.  So it was never kind of something that put me off, but I can see why it…
Interviewer: Yeah.  So it was not a…
Respondent 10: (Overlapping speech 0:25:02)
Interviewer: …for you.
Respondent 10: …target market.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  Can you name me some examples of games that are better than the average game in representation, because you said there are some independent studios that are—?
Respondent 10: Yeah, I think that Overwatch is a really good example.  That has a really diverse cast of characters.  It's also something that we try to do with our games that we make, definitely, but I think it comes quite in line with the people who are here making the games.  We have a very diverse team, so a lot of people just… it just comes naturally to the people who are making the games.
Interviewer: An issue that is widely debated upon is the presence of violence in video games.  All the games you cited to me as games you are playing, I would say are unusually non-violent (laughs).
Respondent 10: (Laughs) Yeah, that's true.
Interviewer: When I think about games, the stereotype in war games, either strategy games or FPS, but you play completely different kinds of games and I'm interested in your point of view on violence in video games.
Respondent 10: Okay.  I guess to me, when I watch people play games like that, or I play them myself, I just don't see much satisfaction in it.  So it's not that I find it really off-putting, it's mostly that just I don't enjoy it (laughs).  I don't get much out of it at all and I don't feel that it encourages you or desensitises you.  I haven't experienced that myself.  I think if I was—  I'm trying to think because (laughs) there's definitely been a couple of games I've played where I've tried to play some horror games and things like that that aren't really quite up there on the violence scale (laughs) and, yeah, I don't feel like I get much out of it.  But it doesn't make me feel desensitised.  I still find it scary.
Respondent 10: I don't know whether there's much correlation there between encouraging that behaviour maybe outside of the game, because that's often talked about, but I think there's definitely a distinction for any player between what's happening in a game and what's happening outside of a game.  I've never felt like the two are confused (laughs), or could be.  It's just not something that I think could happen.
Interviewer: Okay.  And for you personally, violence, I mean, I get the impression it's more indifferent to you.  
Respondent 10: Yeah.
Interviewer: You don't care about it one way or the other, so it's just—  Yeah.
Respondent 10: It has stopped me playing a couple of games before because – I think an example of that was in BioShock, and BioShock Infinite specifically – because I tried to play that game when it came out and I just wanted to progress the story because the story was very compelling, the environments were lovely.  I wanted to know what was going to happen after I started the game, and then very quickly you're given—  Basically, the entire game play is to just commit these acts of violence, and I just didn't want to.  So it put me off that game a lot, which I felt was such a shame because I heard other people say the same, that it was something they would've loved to play but, when it came to actually playing and the input that you have as a player and the actions you have to take, that it just wasn't what they wanted to do in that situation.  
Respondent 10: It was commented at the time that that was quite a lazy design choice because violent games are such a standard that it's what people expect as game play.  But it is quite lazy because there are a whole wealth of other things you can do in a game that is not just shooting a gun or going round assassinating people, or whatever it is that you do.  So it is lazy to me because there's other ways to interact with people (laughs).
Interviewer: Yeah, actually, there are quite really successful games with no violent content.
Respondent 10: Hmm, and I just feel sometimes it doesn't need to be there and it definitely doesn't make sense, and it ruins it for me at that point.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  Another thing I would like to talk about is monetisation because the standard way of selling games is you pay upfront the cost of the game and then you have the game for ever, and more recently there has been an increasing number of games using a subscription model or free-to-play games in which you have micro-transactions inside the game.  What do you think about those?  Have you ever played these kinds of games?
Respondent 10: I have.  I was definitely still playing mobile games when that kind of thing became very popular, and I'm not a fan of that, personally.  I think I'm quite happy to pay upfront the full price of what the developers think the game should cost.  And sometimes that's more than I think it should cost, but it depends on the amount of content and how much time I'll be playing it because sometimes I buy a game that costs £25 and I play it for years.
Respondent 10: So I think it's a lot fairer to just pay a premium price for a game because then it doesn't get in the way of your experience as well.  I find that they can be very in your face with monetisation and it's just not something that I want to think about whilst I'm playing it.  I want to be immersed.  I don't want to have to think about real world things like money.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  Oh, so that's interesting.  You think it's something that breaks immersion.  Okay, that's—
Respondent 10: Yeah, it does for me.  And I think I've played a couple of games where I've actually wanted to buy more content, but that's probably in games like The Sims.  So, in the third one and the second one, I think, you could buy additional items, additional stuff, basically (laughs).  It was kind of more like DLC at that point because it was something you did outside of playing the game.  You kind of just went to the storeroom and got more content.
Respondent 10: So I prefer DLC.  I'm not opposed to that at all.  I think DLC is great because, actually, if I'm enjoying a game, I'm happy to pay more to have more of it.
Interviewer: Yeah, I find it interesting what you said about immersion.  I personally remember some experiences with this kind of immersion breaking.  I remember DLCs in Dragon Age.  I don't know if you know that game.
Respondent 10: Hm-hm, yeah.
Interviewer: Quite a bit in your face, you just had these side quests in the game and you accepted them and then you had to pay (laughs) or you couldn't go on.  Yeah, I can see why you say it's (laughs) immersion breaking.
Respondent 10: Yeah, and it makes you feel like the game's not on your side.  It's very sort of money hungry to me.  But I've paid for the game, so (laughs) what do you want?
Interviewer: (Laughs) 
"Respondent 10: Yeah.  And then if it's kind of an update or something, or a DLC where it's advertised separately and I can search for it myself and find it, then that's okay because it's in my own time when I'm looking for that kind of thing.  But I think it's not very fair to bring it up in the game and say, ""Would you like more of this?  Pay for it.""  (Laughs) "
Interviewer: Okay.  Moving on towards the end of the interview, this is probably the most abstract and difficult question but (laughs) how do you see that games influence society in your experience, in your opinion?
Respondent 10: Hmm.  (Pause)
Interviewer: If you think they do.
Respondent 10: Yes, I think they do.  I feel like there's still a sort of division between people who play games regularly and it's a part of their life, and then people who just don't come into contact with games at all.  There's definitely a lot of people who I think would enjoy a lot of the games that are out that they just don't know exist.  That's always been of interest to me actually and has kind of been one of the things why I've wanted to make games as well, is because I think there's a lot more to games generally as a medium that could bring a lot to people and they just don't know that.
Respondent 10: So I think they do affect society and it's sort of like the people who do play games are in on this kind of (laughs)… like this secret, in a way, because there's a lot of people I know who play.  Like we were just saying, the kinds of games that I play aren't really typical per se, but there's a lot of people who I know – and I have big sort of community around me of people who do play those kinds of games, who do enjoy them – and I can see that these people get a lot out of it.  So I don't quite know how it would affect them, but it's become something that is socially kind of… a big part of the social dynamic, I suppose.  I have groups of friends who will play games together, and that's how they communicate, that's how they socialise with each other.  
Respondent 10: So I think it has affected people in that.  I mean, for a lot of people who aren't near their friends, it is how they socialise with them and it's how they keep in touch with people.  It could be that you are only playing this certain game with this particular friend and they don't live in your city any more and you barely talk to them in any other way.  It's mostly just that you play that game together and that's how you keep in touch.
Respondent 10: So I think it's just another avenue for communicating with people that didn't used to exist, and for making friends as well.  I know a lot of people who have made friends who they've met online first in a game, and then later they've been friends in real life and some of them have even got married.
Interviewer: (Laughs)  Okay.  Before, you said that you see people who get a lot from games, or you kind of mentioned some people who will get a lot of games they are not playing.  Right?
Respondent 10: Hm-hm.
Interviewer: And thinking about what you mean from 'getting a lot' because I get the impression you're not talking just about the entertainment value of video games.
Respondent 10: Yeah, I think so.  So kind of what I meant by that is what I get out of it is this kind of feeling of alone time, like I said really early on.  So yeah, that is kind of how I feel about it when I go to sit and play a game.  I'll pick something that is quite solitary and that's my sort of personal little space that I can nurture in that kind of game.  
Respondent 10: So I think, for me, that's how I get that feeling in my life and I think that's something other people wouldn't expect to get from a game, and so wouldn't look for it there.  But it can be very sort of calming and relaxing, and that's beneficial.
Interviewer: I see.  And also at the beginning of the interview you were talking about games as an artistic medium.
Respondent 10: Yeah.
Interviewer: Well, what do you mean by it?  Do you think games can be art?  Yeah (laughs).
Respondent 10: (Laughs)  Yeah, it's a difficult sort of line that gets crossed between whether something is just a piece of art or whether it is a game because there are a lot of things which are sort of lovely interactive experiences that are very hard to define what kind of game they are, other than just kind of people have started calling, like, a walking simulator (laughs) and things where you just experience something that someone's put together.  And I think those are very much like pieces of art that you could put in a gallery, I guess, that someone could go and experience and it lasts an hour or two, which is akin to kind of similar experiences in other mediums.
Respondent 10: So I think, in that way they're becoming more like watching a film or visiting an exhibition.  But I do think as well that, just inherently, the way that it combines a digital medium and sound and lots of creative input, especially with the story as well, that it is kind of a development in art, just the fact that it's these things combined in a new way.  So it's kind of like a new artistic medium that has yet to be fully experimented and people are just trying things all the time.
Interviewer: Can you name me some games that you believe are artistic, or have artistic value, I mean?
Respondent 10: Yeah.  So there's quite a few recently, and thinking back to kind of a few years ago as well.  So, something like Journey or Flower, or something like Gone Home, or there's a newer game called What Remains of Edith Finch.
Interviewer: I don't know this one.
Respondent 10: That one is a really good one to look at because it really builds on what kind of thing Gone Home did, but it's a little bit more interactive, it's a bit more puzzley.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, yeah, I—
Respondent 10: So those are really nice.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, okay.  Another thing I will actually ask you, and it is related to this topic, given that you are also a developer, is how do you see the future of video games?  How do you see their evolution over time?
Respondent 10: Hmm, it's difficult to say how it will go from here (laughs) because it's changed so much in the last few years with—  I think one of the biggest things was mobile games and the kind of birth of the App Store because it let people self-publish very easily again, like used to be the case but then wasn't for a long time because of big publishers.  So that really opened up the general public's eyes, I think, about who could make a game and the fact that you could make one with your home computer and that kind of thing.
Respondent 10: So it's very apparent nowadays how it's kind of accessible, but it takes a lot of dedication, and obviously funding and things like that.  So it's definitely changed things in the last few years, that people just even know that that's a possibility.  And with technology catching up, it's just been an explosion of people making games on their own, independently.
Respondent 10: I'm not sure how that will continue because I think there's an over-saturation of games generally in a lot of the marketplaces.  So one of the reasons why I stopped playing mobile games or really kind of keeping an eye on what was being released was just because there was just so much and there isn't really a way to—  I mean, some really great games just get completely ignored because… there's nothing wrong with them, but they just don't get seen.
Respondent 10: So it's definitely not very sustainable (laughs) the way that there are so many games right now coming out all the time and I think the marketplaces generally find it very difficult to work out how to curate it or to advertise what there is and really kind of find some of the games that they want to put a spotlight on.  Also, I think for developers, everybody struggles with trying to get seen when you're just starting out.
Interviewer: Hmm.  So you think it's also an advertising problem?
Respondent 10: Well, I think it's a visibility problem.  So it's kind of people who are developing games and putting them on stores, like the App Store, wouldn't know how to make their game more visible because you launch it and it's just in a store with a load of other games and it's not given any kind of priority.  It used to be that, unless Apple picks it, but it's a bit different to that now.  And I think the same with stores like Steam, they just get so many, so many games coming through.
Interviewer: Yeah (laughs).
Respondent 10: So it's really difficult as a consumer at that point to be able to look through them effectively.
Interviewer: Another thing I would like to explore a little bit more is you said that the explosion of mobile games took the games to a wider audience.  Right?
Respondent 10: Hm-hm, definitely.
"Interviewer: But sometimes I get the feeling, also from other interviews I've conducted, that mobile games are seen as a little separate from other kinds of games.  For example, when I, at the beginning of the interview, ask always to people, ""What platforms do you play on?"", they don't ever answer 'mobile games' unless I specifically ask for it (laughs)."
Respondent 10: Yeah, that's interesting (laughs).
Interviewer: Yeah.  It's like they consider it, in a way, a different beast (laughs).
Respondent 10: Yeah, I think it is like that because I think people use their mobiles in such a different way to you would use a PC or a console for playing games because it also serves these other functions and you just kind of have it on you.  It's only when you're stuck in a situation of not having anything else that you kind of game on it, in my experience, and I think a lot of people fall into that category.  
Respondent 10: There are definitely people who don't and they'll play a game on their mobile by choice when they're at home, even, but once you're not on the bus any more (laughs), then you have so many other more sort of… well, I guess kind of immersive, but just you've got a bigger screen, you've got more power, you've just got other ways to play games that are more fitting to your environment.
Respondent 10: So it's kind of just seen as something to do when you're stuck with nothing else.  But I think that is a shame because, I mean, handheld games consoles can deliver very good gaming experiences that can last hours and hours and you can sit playing a game on a small screen in a similar way to you would play a mobile game.  But there's something about how mobile games have kind of… well, I would say steered themselves into that kind of category because of just what's available on the store and them having lower and lower price points and things like not paying anything upfront but then paying later as monetisation.  That kind of thing, I think, cheapens the whole market and you can then not launch a game of substance for a premium price because the audience there just isn't interested.
Interviewer: Yeah, that's interesting.  I do wonder if it's a matter of how these games are monetised and a matter of the type of games, or if it's a matter of the type of audience because maybe these are people who would not play – how can I say – big games anyway.  So I actually don't know (laughs) what generates this kind of dynamic.
Respondent 10: Yeah, it's odd because it kind of all comes about together.  So it's sort of self-perpetuating, I think, that the more people want those short games that are cheap, the more people make them, and then that becomes what the market is.  So it's very difficult to change, I think, once it is set, and it feels very set right now.
Interviewer: So, moving to the last part of the interview, I would like to ask you whether you have any advice to give to different kinds of people who interact with games to make the situation better, or what opportunities do you see in games?
Respondent 10: Yeah, okay.  So out of these suggestions, I think 'parents' is a really key one because there is a lot of stigma, obviously, around what games are, and I don't think that embraces what they can be and the kinds of things that people are apparently making that are educational experiences or really kind of… not so much they have to be educational, but enlightening experiences that are being developed and are available for you to play now and change your views, potentially, on something, or they could just show you someone else's perspective and how that is educational in itself.
Respondent 10: So parents is an area where I think there is just a generational gap, possibly, with what people still think games are.  It could be embraced better as what they might be or they could be, especially in the future if people then show their children and they might go and make games that are more what games could be instead of what they are right now.
Interviewer: I'm a little interested because you said you started playing with your father.  Right?
Respondent 10: Yeah.
Interviewer: Do you think that's unusual?
Respondent 10: Do I think it's unusual?
Interviewer: Yeah.  I mean, I would think you didn't experience this kind of disconnect, generational disconnect.  Yeah?
Respondent 10: Oh yes.  Yeah, not at all really.  I found that to be quite unusual actually.  I've heard a lot of people who work in games say that their parents don't even try to work out what they do for a job.
Interviewer: (Laughs) 
Respondent 10: Or they didn't encourage them at all and that they just don't even talk to them about it (laughs).  I've even heard a lot of people say that their parents discouraged them because they thought that it would be a waste of time, or that it was silly.  So I was very lucky.  I count myself really lucky that my parents were very encouraging from a young age.  But that's because they saw it as this new artistic medium, honestly, so they were just very keen on what could be done with that.
Respondent 10: I know from my dad's case in particular, he would've loved that kind of opportunity going into studying and choosing a career, to have had the technology that we have now and be able to do amazing things and create art, basically, with that kind of technology and those kinds of courses and things that are available now.
Interviewer: Okay.  Any advice you would give to other developers?
Respondent 10: It's difficult because it's obviously a very risky—  It's a business, so it's very risky for developers to take chances on things like very innovative game playing, or I suppose as well, sometimes it's seen as a big risk to do kind of unusual stories or characters that you might not expect.  But I think there's definitely places where you can take risks that aren't very risky (laughs), if that makes sense.  So there's places where you can just think, okay, well does it have to be like that?  Could it be different?  And just make some changes to what you might automatically think of doing.  So, just question what you're doing, I suppose is the advice.
Interviewer: Yeah.  Are you thinking of your BioShock experience and how—?
Respondent 10: Yeah.  Basically, yeah, because I know that there's a lot of pressure on big teams with really, really high budgets that they kind of play it safe with things like game play and the characters.  They're taking risks in some areas, which is how you come up with the [version of infinite thing 0:57:05] because it's very different in terms of story, but it's the same in terms of game play.  So it doesn't connect with those people who then [0:57:17] but it's very difficult to change that or to change a big company that's got a lot of stake in what they're putting out because they can't take a risk like that.  So it is something that independent developers are being a lot more experimental with.
Interviewer: Hm-hm, of course.
Respondent 10: But I think those bigger companies could make some of those decisions without them being risky.
Interviewer: Hm-hm.  So is there any other kind of observation that came into your mind and you didn't know when to say it?
Respondent 10: (Laughs)  I didn't know when to say?  Okay.  Hmm, can't think of anything that I thought of.
Interviewer: Okay.  So I guess this is the end of the interview then.

Interview 11:
Interviewer: As you know we are interested in your experience with games and in what you think about video games and their influence on people, on society. 
Respondent 11: Sorry, are you able to change to voice call?
Interviewer: Is it better?
Respondent 11: (Sorting out sound/video problems).  
Interviewer: It will be about an hour interview, we will use the slides to guide our conversation, I will share some keywords with you, like this, you’re free to use them, not use them to guide your thoughts, they’re not something we are required to talk about but they can help us to just guide the interview. 
Interviewer: You do know you’re being audio recorded, right?  
Respondent 11: Yeah. 
Interviewer: And that’s okay with you?
Respondent 11: Yeah. 
Interviewer: Do you have any questions about the interview before we begin?
Respondent 11: No, happy to crack on.  
Interviewer: I would like to start by talking about your experience with games and what kind of games do you play, how much do you play and so on. 
Respondent 11: Okay, yeah, so I started playing games when I was, just after three years old, got into Mega Man on the old NES and I’ve just been playing ever since really as a hobby.  I play probably an hour or two a day and I play a lot of, sort of PC games nowadays.  I play League of Legends, Moebius, and sort of just adventure games as well.  
Interviewer: How much do you play typically?
Respondent 11: About one to two hours a day I’d say.  
Interviewer: Do you mostly or exclusively play single player?
Respondent 11: No, I play a mix of single player and multiplayer. 
Interviewer: What kind of games in multiplayer?
Respondent 11: The multiplayer will be a MOBA game like League of Legends and also shooters as well, like Overwatch.  
Interviewer: You play also with strangers?
Respondent 11: Yes.  
Interviewer: Only strangers, or also people you know in real life?
Respondent 11: A mix.  
Interviewer: Do you only play on the computer?
"Respondent 11: No, I play mainly on the PC but then I also play a couple of console games every now and then as well; console games tend to be single player, PC games multiplayer.  "
Interviewer: Do you also play on mobile?
Respondent 11: Not really no, no I don’t.  
Interviewer: I would like to ask you, how do you feel that games influence you?  Or how do you feel they can influence people? 
Respondent 11: Yeah, that’s a good question.  I think games can influence people, but it depends on the game.  So if I’m playing League of Legends, which is just an action sort of strategy game, it doesn’t really influence me, the games that influence me tend to be the games that are more like films, like the Last of Us and things like that, games that leave a lasting impression where you remember the ending and there might be a sort of moral story in there, those are the games that I find influence me and my friends.  
Interviewer: How do you feel they influence you?
Respondent 11: I think for me the sort of story driven games that influence me, do so in a way that they’ll teach me something new, or actually they will offer a different perspective, so if I’m playing a game, I’m trying to think of an example here.  Yeah, for example, I think like Metal Gear Solid 4 has a theme of sort of growing old in it, like the character, Solid Snake he’s come back for sort of one last mission and he’s quite old and playing that game gave me like a slightly different perspective on how I saw life.  So for me, games can offer different perspectives, make me think of ideas that I might not have had before, almost like reading a book, you know.  
Interviewer: Yeah, so gaining something from the story of the game.
Respondent 11: Yeah, it’s telling a story, there’s an underlying narrative and yeah, you know, some games have crazy ideas so I think it’s, for me, it’s easy to see that distinction between the games that are just over the top like Twisted Metal, like a crazy car destruction game, that’s not really going to influence me, but the games with deep storylines are.  
Respondent 11: Again like BioShock Infinite where you, I don’t know, have you played BioShock Infinite?
Interviewer: No, I’ve heard about it, but I’ve never played it myself. 
Respondent 11: All right, I don’t want to give away, but there’s something that happens that made me start thinking of, oh could that, if that actually happened would that be the case in real life, you know.  
Interviewer: So they make you reflect on something you didn’t consider, am I right?
Respondent 11: Yeah, consider a different sort of perspective I’d say, yeah. 
Interviewer: I’m also interested, you said you don’t get this kind of influence from action oriented games, but I’m interested in whether you think action video games influence you on a cognitive level I would say, like maybe make your reflexes better or your spatial awareness.
Respondent 11: Yeah I think for me, you’re spot on, it’s the reflexes is what it’s done for me and my ability to think quickly.  Like my wife and I joke sometimes in the house, like if I knock a cup off the side, I can usually, if I knock something, I can usually react and stop it from hitting the floor and I’ll say, gamer reactions, and it’s become a bit of a joke between my wife and I that I’m quite quick to react to things, and I really don’t think I would have that if I hadn’t played the games that I do.  Many games are reaction based, you have to move quickly and react quickly, and I think it’s good brain training.  There have been studies out there that have shown that games can increase your cognitive development and reaction times, and for me it’s the reaction times that games have given me.  
Respondent 11: I think also having that ability to step back and think and look at the bigger picture, because games really encourage you sometimes to not just go charging in through the front door, you might be required to sneak round the back and find a secret entrance and for me, I’ve sort of applied that to my life as well.  There’s never one, the hardest solution, it might seem like just one hard solution to do things in life, but there’s usually another way you can do things. 
Interviewer: So you think you are carrying in real life this ability to take a step back and reassess the situation. 
Respondent 11: Yeah.  I’m not sure I would’ve had that if I’d not played games.  
Interviewer: Another thing I would like to talk about, you said you play League of Legends, which is both collaborative and competitive game at the same time. 
Respondent 11: Yeah. 
Interviewer: Do you think your view on collaboration and competition has changed by playing these kind of games, or even your ability to collaborate and compete?
Respondent 11: No, I’d say I already had that ability, but for me I played a lot of football, so I learnt teamwork and collaboration back then, I think.  So I don’t think I’ve learnt anything new from League of Legends.  
Respondent 11: The only thing I’ve learnt from League of Legends, because the environment, the players can be quite toxic, I’ve learnt, it’s actually given me a thicker skin playing that game.  So it’s taught me that people can be very different when they’re in the game environment as to when they are in real life.  If you get those ten players in real life, I don’t think they’re going to start swearing at each other and calling each other names, but when they’re behind the screen they’re more likely to flame, you know. 
Interviewer: Yeah, and this is something, it took a bit to get used to?
Respondent 11: Yeah, it did because before I played League of Legends I was never, I never really experienced that level of anger, or the insulting sort of dialogue you’ll get.  It’s not all the time obviously but it’s there and I tend to just mute everyone now before I go into a game, so then you don’t get it.  
Interviewer: The last thing I wanted to ask in this part of the interview is whether you think games can be addictive?
"Respondent 11: Yeah, I think they can.  I don’t think more so than any other medium; people are addicted to watching TV or addicted to drugs or alcohol, I don’t think gaming should be something – I think as a human you can get addicted to almost anything, and games is one of those many things. "
Interviewer: But not more so than other activities?
Respondent 11: No, not more so, I’d say equal to, or less.  But it’s hard to say, right, because I don’t know anyone who’s addicted to games.  
Interviewer: Well it also depends on how you define being addicted to video games, which is not clear cut, I get the impression. 
"Respondent 11: Yeah, exactly; because to professional e-sport players, playing seven or eight hours a day, to them it’s not an addiction if it’s part of their job.  "
Interviewer: So the third big question I’d like to ask you is, if you can see any practical application of video games, by practical I mean using video games not just for entertainment, but also for something else. 
Respondent 11: Okay, what so is that, you want me to answer that as a question, or are we going into another question?
Interviewer: No, no, this is the question, can you think about practical applications and if yes, which kind?
Respondent 11: You mean skills that games have given you?
Interviewer: Yeah.  
Respondent 11: Yeah, so obviously what I said earlier, games for me, I play a lot of adventure games so it’s given me that ability to step back.  So if I’ve got a task with work, a lot of it, I think, has helped with work and also dilemmas in life, if you’ve got a situation with friends or a family member, games has helped me to always think about, looking for a second option or a third option.  Being diplomatic as well, I think I’m quite, I think games have taught me negotiation skills over the years.  I’ve played a lot role-playing games where you have like several dialogue options, you know, and that tapped into what I’m saying, it reminds you that there’s so many things you can do in life, you don’t need to just hit the first option.  
Respondent 11: Reaction times, so yeah, practical skills, if someone throws a ball at me or if I’m playing cricket or something like that, I’ve usually got good reactions.  Or if something’s dropped I can usually grab it before it hits the floor and things like that, so yeah those are the main practical ones I can think of.  
Interviewer: Do you think games could be used to specifically train these kind of abilities?  Because I mean these are benefits you gain, I would say accidentally while playing video games for fun, and these are the side benefits.  Do you also think that games could be used specifically for training these activities?
Respondent 11: Yeah, I do, because if you had like a really basic programme on your computer which was reaction based, where for example, maybe like a red dot randomly appears and when the red dot appears you have to click the mouse, if you did that and it was random, so you could never guess when it was going to come up until it came up.  If you did that for half an hour a day, I’m pretty confident like your reactions will improve, or stay at a high level compared to someone who doesn’t do that.  
Respondent 11: So yeah I do believe they can be used as training tools and they are used as training tools.  If you look at McLaren they use a simulation set up for their F1 drivers who practice going round tracks on a simulation and it’s all set up like an actual F1 car.  The same for aeroplane pilots, they have a simulation which helps them learn how to land a plane.  So yeah, I’d say there are definitely practical uses for games.  
Interviewer: Another practical use you’ve already talked about is people who play games to earn money, so professional players in a sense.  What do you think about that?  Do you have any experience about that?
Respondent 11: So e-sport type of things?
Interviewer: Yeah. 
"Respondent 11: Yeah, so I work with the British E-Sports Association so yeah we’ve seen, there’s a lot of positive benefits to come from games.  E-sports is always a different, it’s like a subcategory within gaming, it’s its own sort of separate entity and e-sports is great, because it encourages teamwork, cooperation, communication with your teammates, socialising with your teammates; again working on strategies to overcome, to beat the opposition, overcome a challenge.  "
Respondent 11: There’s a lot of positives from e-sports when done in moderation and a lot of the pro teams now have regimes, so they have exercise regimes, gyms, they’ll have like chefs in their gaming houses, cooking them healthy meals and they exercise every day as part of their regime, so e-sports for me is really positive.  
Respondent 11: When I was growing up I didn’t have anything like that, it was just me playing by myself, it wasn’t ‘til I got to a teenager that Xbox Live came out and online gaming was booming and then I was suddenly talking to people on the other side of the world while I was playing, and that was pretty cool, you know, and now, there are real benefits from it, in e-sports, but yeah when done in moderation I think is the key one to remember.
Interviewer: Do you think, well you’ve already said it’s growing as a phenomena, do you think it will continue growing, it will become widespread?
"Respondent 11: Yeah it is, I mean it is widespread, so if you look at the numbers; I think it’s over two-hundred million viewers around the world and that’s set to break to almost four-hundred million, I think, by 2020.  So it’s on a great trajectory now, but after 2020 we’ll see, the bubble will burst eventually, but at the moment, the next few years it’s just on an upward curve.  All the publishers are making money from it, the viewers’ numbers are going up, and ticket sales are going in and more and more e-sport teams are emerging and investors are getting involved as well. "
Interviewer: Do you know the term gamification?
Respondent 11: Oh yeah, gamification yeah. 
Interviewer: Are you familiar with it?
Respondent 11: Yeah. 
Interviewer: Okay.  Have you had an experience and do you think it is useful or not?
Respondent 11: I’m not sure about gamification, I can see the upsides of it, and I can see that you can get reward cards from high street stores, you know if you buy something three times, if you shop three times in a month you’ll go up a level and then get access to more discounts and things like that.  For me, it doesn’t really affect me that much, because I’ve played so many games over the years I know what companies and things are trying to do when they try and gamify in real life and it doesn’t work with me, that carrot on a stick thing really, unless it’s something I’m really, really interested in, in which case I’ll do it anyway.  But that’s just me on a personal level, I do think gamification does have its benefits, definitely. 
"Interviewer: Moving onto the next topic; do you see any ethical issues in the use of games or in the messages they convey?"
Respondent 11: Yeah, definitely, I think like all creative mediums games’ developers and publishers should be aware of the messaging they’re putting in their games, but at the same time I don’t want – in recent years we’ve seen this weird phenomenon called Gamer Gate where it’s several things but in essence it’s sort of a consumer drive to weed out corruption in games journalism but then also making sure that developers and publishers weren’t pressurised into doing things.  
Respondent 11: I can see both sides of the fence, I of course don’t agree with the threatening behaviour that people had towards critics and developers online, but at the same time I don’t like it when a developer is pressured to change something in their game, which is ultimately like a piece of culture, it’s a piece of art or whatever, it’s a creative project.  It’s not – it’s really difficult, it’s a difficult topic.  
Respondent 11: I think developers and publishers do need to be aware of what they put in their games, especially if kids are playing them.  If a game is an 18+ then it’s an open book for me, developers and publishers should be allowed to express themselves just in the same way that film producers do.  There’s a lot of 18+ films out there that are sick and horrible to a lot of people, but some people like horror films or whatever, they want films like that, they don’t want that creative expression to be taken away.  
Interviewer: You talked before about the level of toxicity in online gaming, do you think that is a problem that should be addressed, or do you think people should be able to freely express themselves in the game?
Respondent 11: I think, like anything, expression is important, being able to express yourself is important, but you can’t just go up to someone and call them an – insulting, your mother did this, blah-blah-blah, you wouldn’t do it to someone in the street and not expect a response, so you shouldn’t be allowed to do it online and not expect to have repercussions.  If you say something disgusting to someone and insult them, there should be punishments there, and developers are trying to take steps to address it, but you’re never going to stop it properly, unfortunately.  Because if you ban a player there’s nothing to stop them coming back with a different account.  So unless the system changes I don’t know what else developers can do to clamp down on toxicity, it’s very, very hard.  
Respondent 11: The only way I think to do it, and I’ve been saying this for ages, is to remove anonymity online.  If we removed anonymity from Twitter and to have a Twitter account or a game account you have to supply your name, or your passport details, we’d soon weed out most of the abuse overnight, because people do it because they can get away with it under an alternative name.  
Interviewer: But personally I’m not this sure about it, I mean I did see some arguments on Facebook, I mean with people using their real names and they are facing their profile pictures and saying things, but that’s just my personal opinion.  
Respondent 11: Yeah I mean there always will be some people, but I just think it’ll be managed better. 
Interviewer: Hmm-hmm, and there will be less of them, you’re saying. 
Respondent 11: Yeah.  But it’s hard to say, of course. 
Interviewer: What would be your estimate of the percentage of toxic people in these kind of games, because?
Respondent 11: Oh, that’s a tough one.  Well in League of Legends I’d say about a quarter of players, yeah about twenty-five-percent.  
Respondent 11: I mean I have some games where everyone seems toxic, now I have other games where no one talks, so about twenty-five-percent if I had to guess based on the time I’ve spent with League of Legends over the past three years or so.  
Interviewer: Another topic I would like to touch upon on the ethical side is that of monetisation of video games, because for example, League of Legends already has an interesting monetisation plan because?  I mean whilst games were all the same in this regard, you know, you pay to game, you had it forever and that was it, and now there are more and more games with subscriptions and DLCs and micro transactions, but how do you feel about those?
Respondent 11: I’m really comfortable with it actually.  I actually like the way that games have gone being predominantly free to play and then having micro transactions, because it gives you the freedom to play as you want it.  Like for me, for League of Legends, I think over the past three years I’ve sent about £250 on the game, which seems an extortionate amount, but for the amount of time I’ve got out of the game, I’ve got a lot more time and fun out of it than I would’ve had spending forty-pound on a boxed game and only playing it for a month and then putting it down and selling it.  So I don’t have a problem. 
Respondent 11: I do have a problem with the mobile in-app purchases, there’s just some ludicrous prices in games.  I think there was a video I watched the other day from Marvel, I can’t remember the name of it, it was a Marvel superhero game on the iPhone, on smartphones and you had to pay something like five-pounds to unlock a box, and you didn’t even get a full character to control some of the boxes.  I think some of the characters you have to spend about twenty-pound to unlock a single character, I think that is ludicrous.  I don’t agree with – I agree with micro transactions when they’re done in a sort of, yeah I guess sort of ethical, a fair way.  I don’t believe in playing a game and having to spend hundreds of pounds in the space of a few months to get anywhere.  
"Respondent 11: Whereas a game like League of Legends where it’s all cosmetic, that’s fine, I pay if I want my character to look good, or if a new character’s come out and I don’t want to wait a while to save up the free credits to get it.  I think that’s – and the prices are fair; I like micro transactions, I think it works well and I think subscription can work well."
Interviewer: You’re saying, when the prices are fair, but I’m not sure I understand if it is a matter of price, I mean how much you have to pay, or a matter of what you are paying for.  I mean cosmetics versus an advantage in game play. 
Respondent 11: Yeah, it depends on the game, it really depends on the game.  For me, I won’t be playing those kind of mobile games, so for me the value of unlocking those boxes is zero, whereas I play League of Legends a lot so I determine things in League of Legends to be a higher value than other games, so I’m more willing to spend money.  So I think if the user – the more a user enjoys a game, the more willing they are to spend a bit more money on it, that’s how I see it. 
Interviewer: The last thing I would like to ask you on the practical side of video games is how do you see the portrayal of individuals, for example on gender representation, race representation?
"Respondent 11: I see it the same as I do films, so I’ll go into every game open-minded, but like I was saying earlier there are some people out there that think, oh my god there should be a certain number of minority characters in games, for fair representation, there should be more female heroines and strong female characters in games.  I do think over the years games probably have been a little bit stuck in the past, but if you look at games in the past sort of five years they are improving a lot; we’ve had some great strong female characters in games, and minority characters in games that probably wouldn’t have been around back then.  "
"Respondent 11: But then, you know, I’m saying that, we’ve had Tomb Raider twenty years ago, that’s a strong female lead.  So I think nowadays where you’ve got Twitter and everything, it’s so easy to express your opinion; you’re always going to upset someone.  If you don’t have enough women in your games, you’re going to upset someone, if you have too many women in your game you’re going to upset someone else.  So I’m just happy for developers to express themselves and just for people, to remind people that games are supposed to be fun at the end of the day, that I don’t think they need to be taken so seriously.  "
Respondent 11: If there’s lesbian relationships in Dragon Age, it doesn’t bother me.  If that helps people out there that think lesbians need better representation in games, then that’s good, but for me personally I don’t look into it too much, and I don’t think developers should worry too much about having to put things in their games, because I think that could stifle creativity in the future. 
Respondent 11: So I can see both sides, so it’s a difficult subject that one.  
Interviewer: Yeah, but you are more on the free artistic expression side?
Respondent 11: I think I am, yeah.  I think if you’d have asked me five or ten years ago, I would’ve been on the, everyone needs to be represented.  But as I’ve grown older I’ve realised, hey the game developers aren’t a bad bunch – a lot have been changed as well.  I mean the amount of games that get released in Japan and the characters are changed before the game is launched in the West is pretty staggering over the years, and it tends to be a lot of like, you know, if there’s a female character with a lot of flesh on display in a Nintendo game it’ll get covered up, and that annoys a lot of the hardcore fans of the game.  But at the same time it probably appeases more liberal thinking people, and like parents who don’t want that kind of thing in the games that their children are playing.  So I can see both sides, I’m kind of on the fence with it. 
Respondent 11: Like you say, yeah, leaning a bit more towards the creative expression side, creative freedom. 
Interviewer: Moving on towards the end of the interview, I want to ask you, how do you feel that games influence society?  If you believe they influence society. 
Respondent 11: It’s a tough one. 
Interviewer: Yeah, I know (laughs). 
Respondent 11: I think they do influence, I don’t know about society as a wider term, I think they influence gamers and the people that play them.  Do video games influence a thirty year old mum who’s bringing up two kids and has no interest in games?  No, I don’t think they do, but they do influence children that play them.  
Respondent 11: I mean you pick up things without realising it.  Now I played a lot of video games as a child and I actually took the positives of games, the games that reward you for doing good actions, for saving a village or doing something you didn’t mean to do to people in the game.  So games influenced me positively, but they can influence people negatively as well.  
Respondent 11: If you just play shooter games, I’ve heard stories of people just playing Call of Duty and then wanting to join the army.  Now would they have wanted to join the army had they not played Call of Duty, perhaps, it’s hard to say.  But I think games do influence the gamers, and more so the children gamers in my opinion. 
Interviewer: This brings the issue of regulating the use of video games, because – I mean do you think that the current restrictions on the age at which you can play certain video games are enough?  Or do you think we need tighter restrictions, or less restrictions?
Respondent 11: I think they’re okay, because I don’t know how you can falsify a restriction, because at the moment there’s nothing to stop a parent buying Grand Theft Auto for their eight year old son, there’s nothing to stop it.  I know in the US I think the, and here, the retail staff have to say, oh just so you’re aware this game is an eighteen.  But from the stories I hear, most of the parents think, oh because my son’s friends are playing the game, it must be all right, and they’d just buy it anyway because of pester-power even though they could [0:38:29].  I don’t know how we can better enforce that. 
Respondent 11: Do I think an eight year old should be playing Grand Theft Auto, of course not, but I don’t know how we’re going to better enforce that without someone going into someone’s home and checking that their children aren’t playing eighteen games, it’s not going to happen.  
Respondent 11: I think the restrictions we’ve got at the moment are fine, PEGI is fine.  What we don’t have, what we need is better education for parents, because I don’t think parents necessarily know what their children are playing.  So for me it comes down to parenting, better parenting than the game age ratings.  
Interviewer: You talked before about games artistic expression, especially when you were talking about how games developers should be free to express themselves in games. Do you actually believe games that have an artistic value can be considered art?
Respondent 11: I don’t know, again that’s another tricky one.  I wouldn’t like to say.  I think art is different for everyone, right, so if I go to an art gallery I will interpret the art differently to other people, and it might express their ideas differently, and that’s great, and I think it’s the same thing with games.  I’ll get something from a game that I will enjoy, one of my friends will dislike it.  I’ll take something from a game that other people might not, so it’s all down to interpretation, so if some games, and people want to view games as art, that’s fine.  For me, I don’t really see them as art, I see them as I do films, a creative tool in medium.  
Interviewer: I would also like to ask you, how do you see the evolution of games over time, because games are different from where they were when we were both younger, and you already said that, online gaming for example has grown quite a bit, and it just wasn’t there or wasn’t this size.  How do you think that the evolution of gaming changed their role, and how do you see the future of video games?
"Respondent 11: Yeah, that’s a good question, the future of video games.  I’m not convinced yet by virtual reality, I know a lot of people are saying, that’s the future, and it could well be.  But for me I just see it as another Nintendo Wii 2.0, it’s a fun gimmick, it’s a fun, cool piece of technology that people like to try for half an hour.  For example, I couldn’t play [0:41:59] for four hours with a reality headset, it would just be very nauseating, but I could sit down for three or four hours and play it.  So cor, I mean the future, once we get to 8K there’s not much more we can go with the human eye.  From articles I’ve done; I used to write for a PC industry magazines, from articles I’ve done, once we get to 8K there’s not much greater sort of detail that the human eye can see past that.  "
Respondent 11: So once 8K becomes the norm in the far future and we have, the graphics have improved as much as they can.  I do think that the cloud and the internet is only going to increase, maybe one day we won’t have consoles anymore, maybe it will just be a service like Amazon, and you have all the games that have ever come out and you can download whatever you want, some are from Nintendo, some are from others, buy them that way.  Other than that, it’s hard to say how else it’s going to change.  
Respondent 11: E-sports is going to continue to grow, but I do think the death of consoles is not too far away now.  
Interviewer: Moving on towards the end of the interview, we’ve talked a bit about problems of video games, opportunities of video games, is there any kind of advice you will give to different kinds of people involved with video games that could make the situation better?  
Respondent 11: You mean for researchers, for who exactly, sorry?
Interviewer: For researchers, players, developers, parents.
Respondent 11: Well for parents, in my role where we’re trying to just educate them as to what e-sports is and the fact that it can offer career opportunities.  I think there’s a lot out there, people out there that don’t realise, gaming isn’t just about, it isn’t just you playing a game and wasting your time or doing something as a hobby, there’s loads of careers, thousands of jobs out there in the game industry.  So I’d stress that point.  I think the games industry is only getting bigger.  
Interviewer: And you think this is underestimated on the side of parents? 
Respondent 11: Yeah, and particularly with e-sports definitely, yeah.  I’d really encourage them to take an open mind and educate themselves as to all the job opportunities and great things there are available for their children.  
Respondent 11: But yes, it’s hard to say, researchers as well, just be very careful – my message to the researchers would be that the e-sports community is very unforgiving, very passionate, very vocal.  So I know there was an example a few months ago of a, I think it was the Institute for E-Sports Leadership, that put a website up and it was a bunch of researchers from around the world, and they called themselves ‘leaders’ because in research, in academia, that’s just a term, right, a leader to, someone that’s looked into an area.  But in e-sports leader means an actual expert that’s been leading in that field for about twenty years, so a lot of people in e-sports were upset when they saw this website and I think the website has gone now.  So just be mindful of researchers coming in saying they’re experts in e-sports and they don’t have any experience in it, that’s not a good idea.  
Respondent 11: But if you say, I’m a researcher and I’m looking into e-sports and this is what I’m studying, that’s fine.  So yeah, I’d just let people know that the e-sports community can be a bit funny and a bit finicky, but deep down it’s just because they care and they love, they have a deep passion for gaming and e-sports, so I think that’s only going to continue as time goes on. 
Interviewer: What would you suggest to developers?
Respondent 11: I don’t think I would suggest anything, the only thing I’d suggest is to be mindful of all the different games out there.  Some gamers don’t have a disposal income that others do, and be mindful of your audience and hitting them with pay DLC after DLC, and just be mindful of that really.  
Respondent 11: Like what you were saying earlier, the influencing factor, be mindful that even if you produce an 18+ game, children would still be playing it but through their parents and – but I wouldn’t want to advise developers too much because I’m not a developer myself and I don’t want – keep doing what they’re doing, producing great?  What I want from developers is more ideas, I want different games, I don’t want to play Call of Duty 25, I don’t want to play FIFA every year, I want to play, I want new experiences, so I’d encourage developers to really think outside the box and come up with some new experiences and be bold and brave. 
Interviewer: What is your suggestion to players, if anything?
Respondent 11: What e-sport players, or just gamers in general?
Interviewer: Both if you have a different suggestion for the two groups.
Respondent 11: For e-sport players just to be professional, because there’s a lot of youngsters out there that are doing some silly things and it can ruin their careers, so be professional and patient.  
Respondent 11: For gamers, be nice and have fun (laughs) that’s it really, yeah.  If everyone followed that I think the industry would be in a better place. 
Interviewer: The last group I would like to ask for your advice is institutions, so for example, the government.  Because you talked about this issue of regulating access to video games, do you think the government should do something different?  Or is it parents’ responsibility?
Respondent 11: Yeah, that’s a good question.  I would say it’s a parents’ responsibility.  Again, you know, I don’t know what the government can do.  I don’t want a state which is controlled by the government like a Korea or something.  I don’t want, I don’t think that’s good, I don’t think that’s healthy for the creative industry.  So I think going down the route, yeah it depends, if the government want to do something they can work on marketing campaigns to better educate the parents.  I don’t think parents know that PEGI age-ratings even exist.  Half the parents probably don’t even know they exist, or care about them, so more education around that. 
Respondent 11: But unfortunately in the times we live in, that’s so far down a government’s priority list, I can understand that also.  But I think if the government should be doing anything, it’s better educating parents, so there’s lots of campaigns and activities they can do, if they wanted to, in that area. 
Interviewer: We are at the end of the interview.  If you want to add something you thought about and didn’t know when to say, or just some closing words.  
Respondent 11: Yeah, closing words I will say, I think that gaming offers a lot of positives and I encourage people to look out, look – explore the different research and publications around them, the research you’re doing for example.  To look into gaming, because times have changed a lot since the Donkey Kong arcades of the eighties and gaming’s in a different place now.  It can be used to tell stories, to educate people, there are so many positives that gaming offers now, like we were saying, increasing your reaction time, your teamwork and collaboration with other people.  
Respondent 11: Even sort of blossoming peoples’ creativity as well.  You know, if I’m a child - when I played Mario Brothers the first time as a child, I was sort of ecstatic with that, it really tapped into my imagination as a child, this plumber running around jumping on turtle’s heads and going down pipes and things, it was just a fun thing.  So I think games can be so good for children when done in moderation.  Encouraging their creativity like I was saying, but also the other benefits, the cognitive benefits.  Yeah, I’d just love to see more people looking at the positives of gaming, because they are out there, you’ve just got to go and look for them.  
Interviewer: Thank you a lot for your time, and if you’re interested I will send you the output of our analysis after we analyse the interviews. 

Interview 12:
Interviewer: The interview is about games, as I said, so both about your personal experience with games and what you think the influence of games is on people and on society.  And I would like to start by asking you what is your experience with games, what do you play, how much do you play?  And if you move to the third slide there are some key words that you are free to use to help you collect your thoughts.  You are not required to touch upon all these topics but if you find them helpful you can use them.  
Respondent 12: Okay, sure.  So first of all when you say games, what I’m involved in is eSports and my definition of eSports are games of skill and which is always human versus human.  
Interviewer: We mean of course all kinds of video games but if your experience is with human versus humans, of course talk about that.
Respondent 12: Yeah, so my experience – so I purely focus on eSports which is competitive video gaming, which is human versus human.  I am slightly unusual in that I am very involved in the organisation of the eSports.  So we set up the British eSports Association and last year we went to Rio during the Olympics and we had an eSports event called the eGames which was eight countries competing in an Olympic like style for medals as opposed to prize money.  So I’m coming from slightly a different background where I’m not an experienced player myself but I’m very much involved in the organisation of events and of an organisation in eSports.
Respondent 12: My experience over the last three years let’s say is purely eSports.  I do have two teenage children who are big gamers so personally my physical time that I spend gaming is a lot less than perhaps my physical time of actually working in eSports organisation.  
Interviewer: How did you start getting involved with eSports?
Respondent 12: Again it was through my children, just seeing what they were doing and what was the set up and again my background is more in traditional sports.  We own a very famous country club in the UK which is golf and tennis and I also work for the FA at Wembley Stadium and I am a member of Wimbledon Tennis Club.  And my uncle, he ran in two Olympics – he was the British record holder [0:06:58] – so I’m very heavily involved in sport.
Respondent 12: And then I saw the benefits of eSports via my children playing these games so I’m coming from a—  In the UK…
Respondent 12: (Lost connection 0:07:11)
Interviewer: Sorry, I lost you for a moment.  You were saying in the UK.
Respondent 12: Alternative to passive media so instead of watching rubbish tv or social media I encourage my children, in moderation, to [0:07:36] eSports as opposed to playing video games.
Interviewer: And you were talking about how this Olympics styled event is unusual because it is for medals and not for money, so usually the events you organise money prizes?
Respondent 12: Sorry, you cut out – so what was the question again?
Interviewer: The question is, usually these kinds of events have money prizes?
Respondent 12: Yes.  So the reason why, again we work with the British government and we went with them in Rio during the Olympics and people like in any sport you have events for prize money but you also have events that are for national pride, for your country.  In tennis you have the Davis Cup, in golf you have the Ryder Cup but no one was doing it in eSports until we did it last year at the Olympics.
Interviewer: And do you play games yourself?
Respondent 12: No.  I wish I had the time!  (Laughs)  I am slightly unusual – our main business, we actually build and run hospitals for governments.  So we work in a, well we have worked in fifty-two countries and we’ve worked for twenty-four governments.  I’m very much on the kind of organising, administration side of it, also the education side of eSports.  We are doing now a pilot study in a library in London with Westminster Council and we’re working with three universities in the UK about doing some pilot studies into the benefits of eSports.  And again, in moderation and part of a balanced life.
Interviewer: Yes, this brings us nicely to the second part I would like to explore which is the effect of games on people.  You are already talking about benefits of eSports, what kinds of benefits do you see?
Respondent 12: In the UK we have actually got a list of stuff.  So [0:10:12] there’s a whole list of stuff that has been proven and we’re working with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.  Things like communication skills, leadership skills, dexterity is very important, there are future jobs for people who have got good dexterity like surgeons or drone operators.  There are also a lot of intrinsic rewards.  So a sense of pride, sense of acknowledgements.  
Respondent 12: On studies that we’re working on, again this is purely eSports and less so video games, there are a lot of transferable skills.  And we’re working now also with the Department of Health and the Department of Education on promoting, in moderation, that this is a great mental well – eSports are great for your mental wellbeing.  But we are making it really clear that there are some sensitive issues which you put there.  Addiction can be an issue, that can be driven for making money but also I think there’s a difference between the addiction of playing a computer versus the addiction of playing eSports because with eSports you’re playing different people which has a different outcome, whereas if you’re playing a computer there’s an element of repetition.  
Respondent 12: So we’re really keen in the UK to differentiate between eSports and video games but if it’s controlled or if the people are educated about certain games being good in moderation, that’s part of our aim.  I sit on the British eSports Association and the education play is big.  People are concerned about addiction but the reality is three per cent of the population get addicted to anything and that’s what it is.  I think that you’ve got to be aware of it but as a parent you need to monitor what games they are physically playing, who they are playing with and [0:12:28] and making sure that they are all age related.  You shouldn’t ever let a young person play the wrong games.  In the UK we’re quite specific on age rated games.
Interviewer: I’m interested because you talk about the benefits of eSports if played in moderation and I would like to ask you how do you determine when you go over this moderation and you—
Respondent 12: Yeah, that’s a very good question.  I think that’s one of the studies we’re trying to do.  I think if you take the balanced view approach, depending on what age you are, as a child you need to obviously sleep well but you’ve got to do some physical activity, you’ve got to do your school work which is educational.  The area that we are focusing on is in the evening when you can’t be outside playing football, you can’t be doing certain activities and you’ve done your homework, it’s that window of time when you’ve got your free time that, as I say, rather than—
Respondent 12: If you did a study of how many children used to just watch tv ten years ago, one could say that they were addicted to television ten years ago because the amount of hours they play whereas if you—  And this is what we are trying to quantify is depending on how many hours children are playing, obviously if they’re playing none stop for twenty-four hours that’s ridiculous, but is it two hours, is it three hours?  If you did an analysis if they were playing two hours a night of chess or three hours a night of chess, would you say they’re addicted to chess?  No parent is going to say to a child, you’re playing too much chess but they would definitely say you’re playing too much video games.
Respondent 12: So I think there’s a sensible approach.  Do children historically watch two hours of tv ten years ago at night, maybe they did maybe they didn’t, so it does depend on each child and it depends what game they’re playing.  Because as you know of the kind of thirty different eSports certain games are very [0:14:51], certain games take up to hours to play so I think you’ve got to be aware of it but I think there isn’t enough study yet on what defines addiction.
Interviewer: I get the impression that for you it’s not more about how much time do you play but how much it disrupts other activities, right?
Respondent 12: Exactly, yeah.  We’re really pro balance life.  We’ve got some great Olympians who, you know, they play, they physically train six hours a day during their [0:15:32] and then they’ll play three or four hours at night but that’s their – they’re not watching tv for three hours a night so what have you—  I [0:15:41] which would be great as a study would be to do the stats versus watching tv which is obviously a passive media and playing e-Sports.  
Respondent 12: And again, I’m just repeating myself, I definitely see a difference between eSports and video games because you are competing with other people and while you’re playing you’re talking leadership skills, strategy, there’s a lot of transferable skills.  And one of the projects the government liked is these kids have got cyber skills, there’s a lack of people with cyber – there’s a lack of cyber professionals so if we can tailor—
Respondent 12: I think if a lot of the kids realised that what they’re playing is really good for them they might think this is a bit not as cool as it is (laughs) but I think there are – in my personal view I think certain e-Sports are better for your brain than chess.  And as I’ve said you’ll never get parents saying oh my child’s playing too much chess, no one would say that.  
Interviewer: Yes.  This may be kind of a weird question, but do you see the relationship between eSports and sports because when you were talking about how these people can play, I don’t know, two hours in the evening of an eSports and if they didn’t they would be watching tv for two hours.  So it’s like it takes place of entertainment and this kind of leisure time.  Could it also take the place of traditional sports?  I don’t know if I’m making…
Respondent 12: I think in the UK it’s not because I think the position of eSports is very different.  I think in Asia unfortunately I think they’ve made too much of an emphasis on how important eSports is and in Asia they push eSports as [sport 0:17:53] so there’s a mixed message as a child growing up that that is a good thing.   At the very elite level you have to be physically fit to be a pro gamer, the pro teams all have nutritionists, they all have trainers, and they go to the gym every day.  The top elite players are physically fit, they have to be to be mentally fit.  
Respondent 12: I think in the UK our positioning is we’re not trying to rival or replace sport at all and if anything it’s a complement.  There’s a very famous female boxer, Nicola Adams, she won gold in Rio I think it was, and she said, “I played chess as a child to get my mental ability to help my physical ability.”  So I think with eSports if you’ve got good mental wellbeing it’s good physical wellbeing as well.  I think they go hand in hand.  So of the big sports organisations that I work with including cricket and rowing and football, they’re seeing eSports as a complement, they’re seeing it as a complement and not a rival.  They are reinforcing their brands like FIFA and [stuff 0:19:01].  
Respondent 12: And as I say, I think the key messaging for me with parents is when they said, “Oh my kids play lots of video games” I go, “Well are they playing video games or are they playing eSports?”  And then I go, “What game are they playing?”  Are they playing the rugby or whatever? And I go, “When are they playing?”  And for most people in England we’re sport obsessed, that’s part of our culture, if the kids were playing during the day when they could be outside then that would be an issue.  They tend to play early evening and the night.  Do you track – do you look at twitch and look at the viewership figures it’s not during the day because obviously they’re at school or whatever, but I think there’s a concern and a generalisation but from my experience, my kids they play football, they play rugby, they play tennis, they play golf and in the evening…
Interviewer: Yeah, so that they don’t conflict with each other?
Respondent 12: No, exactly.  And a classic one is I had a chat with the chairwoman of English rowing, the Olympic rowing team for England, and she was quite aggressive with me in a good way and she said two things.  She said, “How can eSports improve physical activity?”  So first of all I said, “Well that’s not eSports’ role, eSports’ role is to help your mental activity.”  And then she said, “Well okay, well why are my children playing the same game every night, it’s monotonous.”  And I go, “No, no, no, if you play tennis every day or play football every day you’re physically and mentally not doing the same movement, you’re not playing, you’re doing – you’re playing against opposition so it’s changing how you play all the time.”  
Respondent 12: And so I think there’s a lack of education with parents about this.  Obviously if they’re playing until two and three in the morning that’s not good for you and that’s a control thing from parents.  But I think, like anything, if you did bullet points of the benefits and the excitement and the engagement of playing eSports you can understand why children are playing it.  There’s a lot of crap going on in the world, you’re escaping from reality into this electronic world.  So I can see why eSports have become very popular because there’s a lot of rubbish on tv and people – my children, unfortunately, are seeing all this death and terrorism so actually playing something fun is making them feel good.  
Interviewer: What kind of games do you organise events for?
Respondent 12: In the UK next year we are doing British Championships.  So my philosophy with the people that we work with is that like any sport you need hero’s so in the UK we think there are around thirty, thirty-five eSports so we’re going to be organising a championship that people can aspire at certain – to be good at certain things.  We’re doing a pilot in libraries, we’re doing some work in schools and we’re potentially rolling out some stuff next year into universities.  Are you speaking to Josh Williams from [0:22:31] NUEL?
Interviewer: Sorry?
Respondent 12: Are you speaking to a guy called Josh Williams?
Interviewer: No, I don’t think so.  Let me check, maybe…
Respondent 12: He’s very important.  He runs an organisation called the NUEL which is the National University ESports League.  They have over a hundred and five universities playing every Wednesday afternoon.  They have five different eSports titles against each other.  They would be quite useful to talk to.  
Interviewer: Let me see.  Maybe some of my colleagues are interviewing him.  I will have to check.  Anyway, another thing I would like to ask you about, also about eSports, is how is competition [league 0:23:43] in eSports and the collaboration for team based sports?
Respondent 12: [League 0:23:53], yeah if you take each game it has its own set up, rights, your own league [0:24:00] they control all their leagues.  Traditionally most publishers don’t really get too involved in events.  In the UK a company called ESL have I think the premiership.  Most eSports events tend to be one off competitions so this weekend, in fact today and tomorrow and Sunday at Wembley Arena there will be about four thousand people watching an ECS event for a Counter-Strike CS:GO.  But that’s like a one off tournament and then Gfinity who are another tour organiser, they’ve just created the elite series and the challengers series.  So they’re doing a twenty week league for eight teams and they did a [drafting process 0:24:46] so that’s quite a good model for you to look at.  Do you know who Gfinity are?
Interviewer: [0:24:55] sorry.
Respondent 12: Gfinity, have you heard of Gfinity?
Interviewer: No, never heard of it.  What is it?
Respondent 12: They are a tournament organiser in the UK, they turn over about five million.  If you google Gfinity London and they’ve got a thing called the elite series, that’s just started this year so that’s quite an interesting pro level league.
Interviewer: Okay.  I’m Googling it right now!  
Respondent 12: And then at schools there’s a thing called the Digital Schoolhouse which is a Rocket League where four hundred schools compete in that.  Sony PlayStation sponsor that,  that’s called the Digital Schoolhouse and that’s a Rocket League.  
Interviewer: Something I would like to ask, how are the teams of players managed in this kind of event because—?
Respondent 12: You have professional teams, so in the UK the two main teams - one is called Fnatic and the other one is called Dignitas and they are proper teams.  They’ll have about fifty to sixty players, they’ll have about thirty support staff.  They get paid a salary and then they get a share of the prize money which normally is between seventy-five to eighty-five per cent of the value goes to the players and then the team owns the commercial rights.
Interviewer: Okay, how were these teams created?  Was it…
Respondent 12: (Overlapping speech 0:27:05)
Interviewer: Yeah, I mean did these teams form – how can I say, were they formed from the players, they just teamed up and began competing or was it more of a top…
Respondent 12: Yeah, Fnatic and Dignitas have got team owners and team managers and these teams have been going for like ten, fourteen years.  They’re proper teams, they’re like Chelsea or Liverpool, they’re proper—  And the way that the teams work,  they’ll have a team per title so some of these teams will have a squad playing [0:27:59] a squad playing Counterstrike, a squad playing Call of Duty.  The organisation tends to just have a team – they play in team eSports and not some so much the individual eSports.  But then they’re properly run and [0:28:18] globally there’s probably around a hundred of these teams at that level turning over millions of dollars.  
Respondent 12: And then you’ve got amateur teams where it’s a group of friends come together to play in the tournament.  And that does vary but in the UK the two main teams are Dignitas and Fnatic which they cover different eSport cycles and then you’ll get certain teams that specialise in only one title.  So the problem with eSports is it’s very fragmented and it’s very complex but it’s very easy to find out on the stats and data who are the better players in each country.  So forming teams is relatively easy and it’s just about money.
Interviewer: Uh-huh.  I would like to move on to the next topic of the interview which is about practical application of games.  You work with practical application of video games, these people who are playing eSports earn money and they gain benefits as you said, but I’m also interested in a little bit more in how do you see the relationship of eSports with schools?  You have already said that you collaborate with schools but can you tell me a little bit more about this?
Respondent 12: Yeah, so the main initiative that already started this year was this thing called Digital Schoolhouse which is sponsored by PlayStation so they did a Rocket League final.  Do you know the game Rocket League?
Interviewer: Yeah.
Respondent 12: You know the game yeah, Rocket League?
Interviewer: I know it by name but I don’t know much about it.
Respondent 12: Okay.  So it’s a three versus three eSport where you’re playing football with rocket powered cars.  It’s a brilliant game.  It teaches you defence, attacks, leadership skills, it teaches you how to collaborate with three people, strategy, and it’s a fantastic online learning game basically.  So I think four hundred schools in the UK played and they played the final at the Gfinity’s studio during London Games Week in April which we actually – I think we did, yeah we did a video on that and everything so I don’t know—  Have you looked at the website British eSports dot org, have you looked at that?
Interviewer: Yeah, when I saw your email, yes, I did take a look at that.  I didn’t know it before, actually.
Respondent 12: Yeah no problem.  So if you have a look on there there will be a video of that event and there’s a summary of the scores and everything.  And we’re being contacted by schools about setting up eSports clubs like chess clubs and so there’ll be more next year, there’ll be more activity in it.  And again it’s part of our role to educate the schools about what are the better games and how to set up these clubs.  
Interviewer: I would like to ask you a little bit more about how you see the relationship between eSports and physical health because typically video games are seen as a sedentary activity, so they’re seen as potentially harmful in the way of health.  But on the other hand you’re presenting eSports as very healthy and requiring physical fitness, I would like you to elaborate a little more on that.
Respondent 12: Yeah I think it’s at what level and, as I say, what is part of this balanced life point of view.  I think at the elite level, the pro level, you have to be [0:32:56], you can’t be a professional eSports player if you’re unhealthy, you have to be mentally alert, physically alert and you have to be fit with your dexterity.  So I think at the elite level it’s not an issue, you know, sport, physical activity is paramount.  
Respondent 12: And I think at your lower level [0:33:17] opinion, it’s not the role of the eSports to promote physical activity but it’s to promote mental wellbeing, right?  As I say, everyone’s – in my opinion everyone’s saying oh eSports is damaging sports and I’m going, “No, no, no, no, eSports is great for mental health and eSports is damaging for the tv.”  So if you [0:33:44] but the reality is when these kids are playing eSports you can’t do physical activity, you can’t go [0:33:54], you play football outside in the dark.  So you can’t play tennis outside in the dark.  So eSports when they’re playing it you can’t do sport.  So you prefer your [0:34:14]…
Interviewer: Yeah so it – it’s eating other screen time you are saying?
Respondent 12: …it’s that simple for me.  Yeah it’s your recreation time but it [0:34:25] playing the games at night, you know.
Interviewer: Okay.  Moving on, do you see any ethical issues in the use of games and in eSports?  Ethical issues of any kind.
Respondent 12: I think on the [0:34:47] there’s been a lot of study about is there a link between [0:34:53] and eSports I think that proves that there isn’t.  You know, if people have mental illness or anger issues that’s not caused by playing video games.  I think the only issues that is a sensitive one is the fact that certain games [lead to be 0:35:13] a bit more toxicity just by their nature which I know that the platforms are doing a lot of great big work to get rid of that.  The other good thing about eSports is it’s gender neutral and it’s disability neutral as long as you’ve got obviously your hands and your arms.  
Respondent 12: So I think, personally I don’t think there’s much to [0:35:39], I think the diversity question is because there isn’t the right game for [0:35:43-47] my understanding [0:35:48] study done as a child boys like playing with footballs and toy [0:35:53] and girls like puzzles.  But if you do an analysis of the top eSports the top eSports all have either a football or have a gun or [0:36:08].  There isn’t a fantastic puzzle eSports, so someone’s going to make a lot of money by doing that [0:36:14] because we’re totally open, we’re completely gender neutral.  So personally I don’t see as bad as people are making out but obviously if people have got issues it’s not because they’re playing an eSport or it’s the cause of that.
Interviewer: And are eSports themes usually gender mixed?
Respondent 12: The majority at the moment is male, just because they’re the better players.  But there are, globally there are [0:36:53] some fantastic female players.  In South Africa the captain of South Africa is female and there are certain games like Street Fighter where you’ve got significant female players.  And then there’s a great organisation called SKYLLA which is a female only league and they’re not being sexist against men, what they’re doing is they’re like a training camp to develop female talent before then once they get to a certain level then they play in the main tournaments.  But it’s just a safe environment for them to play and learn for some people—    
Respondent 12: What you’ve got to think about is that when you play most of the time online no one knows if you’re male or female anyway because you have a [gamers 0:37:41] tag.  So it’s only [0:37:45] so again people love sort of like going on about how sexist it is, there’s no barrier.
Interviewer: But you said about these female teams that it is like a safer environment, so do you believe female players perceive other environments to be unsafe for them or less—?
Respondent 12: Yes, sorry, so what I meant by safer is it’s an area where women aren’t embarrassed about their skill level.  So it’s not safer as in aggression it’s safer as in if you want to learn a skill it’s a female friendly league called SKYLLA, [S-k-y-l-a-a], I think they’re based in Germany.  It purely is to help develop your skill set not – it doesn’t—  So when I meant to say for [0:38:39] emotionally [0:38:41] that you’re not going to be frightened that you’ll be beaten.  It’s kind of like a training league as it were rather than worrying that some man’s going to be [0:38:53] it’s very much—  
Respondent 12: So it’s probably worth you reaching out to them because that’s a good model.  Because I had an issue I was saying, “Well are you anti men?”  And they went, “No, we just want to develop talents to a good level and release the women after that” which I thought was a great way of doing it.  Because you know you have got people [0:39:16] playing with other sexes.
Interviewer: This thing about gender is a difference between eSports and traditional sports because I mean at the professional level most physical sports are divided between men and women.  So eSports don’t have this kind of barrier I would say.
Respondent 12: Apart from racket sports, yeah - badminton is [mixed 0:39:51], it’s [0:39:52] is mixed, so there are sports where you play as mixed.
Interviewer: Yeah.  Okay, moving to the next topic how do you see the relationship between eSports in your case and the society?  Are eSports changing the culture, are they having an influence?
Respondent 12: I’m hoping that – we’re doing this pilot study now in a library in London and the two main reasons we’re doing this is one we’re trying to encourage people to come back into a library which is very good as a centre of learning, and we’re doing that by saying when you do homework or revision you need to have a break and eSports is good for you to do that.  The other one is to take kids off streets that can’t afford to play games and give them some confidence and skills and teach them.  
Respondent 12: So I think that society, once people understand the positioning and the one thing that I’m personally very keen to amplify is that eSports isn’t all about the money, people aren’t—  You can win money but people are playing it like they’re playing sport, you get some people who play sport for money and some people that don’t.  I think it can show the benefits of what you do at the elite level by winning money.  The winning team last year five guys won nine million dollars, one team, five players won nine million dollars.
Interviewer: That’s a lot.
Respondent 12: So that’s at the elite level.  So a [couple of kids there are want 0:41:48] to become a professional eSports player, I’m sure a lot of kinds say they want to be a professional footballer.  But I think once people are educated about the right games at the right age and the benefits of the different types of eSports, which is going to take time, I personally feel that it will have an influence because if we can steer children to playing games which we know will have a long term transferable skills, will teach them online problem solving skills, rather than watching passive media where they’re just looking at the television or they’re watching videos of monkeys fighting or whatever.  If people actually got into the deep thing that actually these games are enhancing your cognitive behaviour, in moderation, part of your balanced life that, I think, will help society.
Interviewer: Okay.  Do you…
Respondent 12: I’m a believer, as you can tell!  (Laughs)
Interviewer: (Laughs)  Do you have any other kinds of suggestions to people involved with games and eSports about what could be done to make the situation better and spread the use of eSports which I can tell is your wish?
Respondent 12: Yeah, spread the message.  I think if you take one step back and everyone I meet I’m very consistent on my message, on my narrative.  The reality is eSports are different to video games because you’re always playing against a human.  So in my opinion that is like chess, there are intrinsic rewards from playing, fundamentally you are happy playing these games.  On an emotional spectrum playing games, physically or mentally games are good for your emotional state.  
Respondent 12: If, as I say, if you look someone in the eyes and said, Would you prefer your child to watch two hours of cartoons or two hours of reality tv or two hours of a programme about, I don’t know, a monkey fighting another monkey or would you want your child to spend two hours communicating a strategy on how to win a game against other people and learning leadership skills and [0:44:38] skills and dexterity?”  What would most people say?  They’ll say, “Well obviously we want them to learn these skills.”
Respondent 12: So I think there’s an education [0:44:50], I think that people unfortunately just say, “Oh my kids play on these games, it’s a waste of time.”  And I go, “Well which games are they playing?  How often are they playing?”  I think there needs to be a bigger education about it and it’s fun to play video games so we’re not anti video games we’re just saying that there are some really good benefits in eSports.
Interviewer: Is this kind of education you say should be done, what should be the source?  I mean should it be government initiative, private association initiative in university or—?
Respondent 12: Yeah, I think we’re being very open with you - where we’re at now is the government are very aware of it but they just need proof, they need evidence.  So by us doing these pilot studies in libraries and probably what you guys are doing in universities, once we prove that in moderation this is a beneficial thing to do then the government Department of Education, Department of Health will encourage it.  We’ve got to be very careful that, you know, there’s no way that the Minister of Sport is going to support this if they see it’s competition.  But also sporting companies or associations if they start working with it and they complement each other or they reinforce their brand then it’ll work.  
Respondent 12: But I think government is important but it’s the academics – the academic process is number one, to get evidence to prove what we need to prove and then there’s a roll out of doing that.  And again, you could go back twenty years thirty years and look at chess, when kids did chess clubs in schools and then you—  Chess has been proved to be good for you.  ESports is the same thing, there’s no difference.
Interviewer: Okay.  We’re moving to the end of the interview and I would like to ask you if there is something you would like to add that we didn’t touch upon.
Respondent 12: As I say, I know I’ve said it twenty times, I think there is a difference between eSports which is the competitive video gaming aspect of it’s human versus human playing games of skill.  I think more research will be done and I think if we had this conversation in a year in the UK there’s going to be a total different thing.  Matt Hancock who’s the Minister of Digital, he’s in charge of [overseeing that 0:47:42].  And also you’re going to have I think more recognition about eSports from sporting associations and institutes.  I think you’ll see more of an understanding of eSports.
Interviewer: I will close the interview and thank you a lot for your time and contribution.  

Interview 13:
Interviewer: So thank you a lot for agreeing to be interviewed.  As we said on our email, this is an interview on your experience with games and what are your thoughts about games, how they influence people and society in general.  I will share some PowerPoint slides with you, can you see them?
Respondent 13: Yeah, I can see that, yeah, all good.  
Interviewer: Okay.  These are slides just to help us guide our conversation, so I will share with you some key words like this, that you are free to use, you are not required to use them, but they can give you some help in some questions that may be difficult to tackle at the beginning, okay?
Respondent 13: Okay.  
Interviewer: Do you have any questions about the interview? 
Respondent 13: No, just more about what the output of it was, what’s the purpose of the interviews and what’s your kind of final objectives. 
"Interviewer: Yes, this is part of a bigger project on the impacts of games on people and society, so we – in the first part of the project we did a little of bibliographic research to see the academic point of view and now we are conducting interviews with several people, so researchers, players, policy makers, educators, to get their insight on games; and then we will move on from that to try to find where there are mismatches and, you know, what we can gain from engaging more closely to people involved in games.  "
Respondent 13: Okay, sounds good.  
Interviewer: So I’d like to begin by asking you about yourself and your experience with games, so as a player what kind of games do you play and how much, and so on?
Respondent 13: Yeah, so personally I’ve been playing games for a long time, I think I first played in arcades and so on, and then I guess now, I play anything, time permitting, that’s the restriction now unfortunately.  So the, having started with a PC, console, and less mobile I guess, so yeah. 
Interviewer: You do play also mobile, okay. 
Respondent 13: A little bit, yeah, but not so much really, I guess if you count the Switch as my one app this year, that would be it.  
Interviewer: You said you play not as much as you’d like, how much do you play, how much time?
Respondent 13: Probably, actually with the Switch more now, so I used to play, I guess I played an hour every evening, it’s the pressures of family life if nothing else, that’s really the restrictor, so I try and play an hour every evening, but I guess with the Switch and so on, the more mobile devices, I probably play a couple of hours a day.  
Interviewer: When did you start playing?
Respondent 13: 1980, no a bit later, ’85 maybe, yeah. 
Interviewer: Okay, quite a bit of time ago. 
Respondent 13: Yeah, yeah. 
Interviewer: How old are you now?
Respondent 13: Forty-five.  
Interviewer: So you’ve probably seen quite a bit of evolution in games, I’d say.
Respondent 13: Yeah, but I mean fundamentally the core of them remains the same, they are fun, immersed and so on, but I mean increasingly now what we’re seeing is obviously the, I guess the more sophisticated ideas and topics they tackle.  I mean certainly [0:04:54] games, where you play a game, you get so immersed that you can’t help but take the kind of moral point of view sometimes or, but I guess they’re more explicit now, but at their core, you know, the things that I loved about games when I first started playing is still the same things I love about games now.  
Interviewer: Which types of game, you say you play mostly everything, but?
Respondent 13: Yeah, so I guess more specifically, erm, what do I play, so I see more PC games, so I play [Movers 0:05:27], well I played one [0:05:29] those two a lot, so I play really games that allow a bit more depth of thinking, but also – I’ve played a lot Zelda recently, less arcade shooters I guess. 
Interviewer: So moving on, I would like to ask you, well you’ve been a player for a long time, so do you believe games had an influence on you?
"Respondent 13: Yeah absolutely, I think, you know, the whole point both personally and professionally [0:06:04] is the point that it’s not just; they do have an impact on individuals but also the culture as a whole.  I think some of my, I’ve had a fairly healthy mix of, you know, of films, books, whatever, but games has undeniably has had a big effect on, you know, how you see the world and so on, and I think that’s just increasingly so, I think people are acknowledging that, it’s just as a, as the way they express culture but also the way they actually influence how people do things, like e-sports and so on, the way that they’re actually, that’s influencing.  So yeah, absolutely they do have an impact on that. "
Interviewer: Can you give me an example of an influence you have seen on yourself by playing?
Respondent 13: It’s a sort of basic level, games like playing Elites, from the first one, I remember playing it huddled round a BBC micro with my mates to the new one that gives you an understanding of, I guess physics and cosmology and so on.  I think games, you know, Civilisation, but also less so obviously profound but, I don’t know, those are two good examples I guess, but they have to be?  I think the point is, it’s not just games are explicitly about educating things, [See-it 0:07:34] is the obvious one, because you’ve got to get into, it’s a simulation of world history, you’re – about world history through that.  
Respondent 13: But even, you know, I guess things like Call of Duty will also teach you about warfare and the moral decisions involved and things like that, to a certain degree, and yeah I don’t think, I think you – I always hate the phrase, serious games, because it seems completely wrong, the whole point about games is they are fun, but games do have a meaning to them and you can learn from them.  
Interviewer: You say you also play online, right?
Respondent 13: Yeah. 
Interviewer: Did playing games change your approach to competing with other people, collaborating with other people?
Respondent 13: From Change-It, no, I mean I think, I did play at other sports and so, but I think it’s the same, it’s the same human instinct to play and enjoy yourself.  
Interviewer: I’d also like to ask you, before you talked about how games are changing, but the core remains the same, the immersion and fun, what are the elements in games that help you find this kind of feeling, if you can find that?
Respondent 13: So, that’s a good question, I mean obviously I think the look of them and the kind of, the constant adoption of the new technologies [0:09:12] yeah they do increasingly get more, it’s ones like lifelike, it’s about, you know, the different art styles that’ll be accommodated within that and so on.  You can get sort of, you know, Zelda you get these proper moments where you’re standing on a mountain top admiring the view as it were.  But also just, you know, a bit of problem-solving, the level of concentration required I guess, you have to – with games like [0:09:36] constantly you’ve got cognitive and so on, you’re making split second decisions on – well there’s quite a lot of, there’s decision making based on a lot of variables made very quickly, so I think that is an enjoyable thing to do and if you can make the right decisions at that speed it’s very satisfying.  
Interviewer: So you will say that the complexity and difficulty level of a game also helps immersion, is that what you’re saying?
Respondent 13: Yeah, I mean but then, you know, you’ve got a game ? I played a lot of the latest Mario Kart which has, in terms of control it’s not that difficult, based on making those quick decisions and the pest developments, so yeah.  I guess, yeah, it’s like that, that magic mix of getting the difficulty curve right just against accessibility, but I think I’m more inclined towards the, the slightly more complex games rather than sort of casual games.  
Interviewer: Do you think games have the potential for addiction?
Respondent 13: No, I don’t, so we get a lot, we get asked a lot from Ukie, and we’re getting – yeah, we’ve looked into it from every different side, we never put our head in the sands about it, but there is no clinical definition of it, there’s no proven link to it at all.  I think that word gets banded around kind of, as a, in a different sense, so people say, is it a good way often, you know, that’s really addictive, so it means it’s actually really good fun and people love to play it. 
Respondent 13: I think it’s easy because the games are so amazing, to potentially play too long sometimes, but that’s like anything that’s fun, and yeah I mean the cases we’ve seen that are, have led to kind of bad results there are, in most cases, some underlying other issues that are going on with those individuals.  So yeah, the games may be seen as a cause but actually they’re a symptom of something else, there are people who may have other bad stuff going in their life, sort of chaotic lifestyles and so on.  Not all the time, I understand, but yeah I mean, there’s no, they’re not addictive in that sense.  
Interviewer: I find it funny that you say addictive in a good way, because I actually saw some other advertisement for games that said, this is the new most-addictive game, so putting a positive light on this kind of, you know, ‘addiction’ is a loaded word, but negatively loaded usually.  So it was funny to see this reverse up with games. 
Respondent 13: Yeah, there was a guy – there was also, I don’t know if you saw the, when the snooker world championships, there was an Australian snooker player who was over in the UK, at a kind of snooker world championships and amazingly the headlines said he’d been addicted to video games and it was affecting his snooker, and it was weird, because I thought it wasn’t so long ago where being good a snooker was a sign of a misspent youth, and now video games?  We got contacted by the BBC or someone about it, and I was speaking to a journalist and said, wouldn’t it be actually good if it said that, a story in five or ten years’ time saying, snooker’s really interfering with my e-sports career.
Respondent 13: Yeah, it’s a kind of a culture thing, people blame games and they don’t understand it, and yes, you can play games for a long time, because they are amazing, but if you’re sensible you get up and go for a walk and so on every now and again, it’s fine.  
Interviewer: Moving to the theme of our interview, do you see any practical obligation of video games, by practical I mean using video games not just for entertainment but for a specific purpose?
Respondent 13: Yeah, absolutely, it’s partly again, both personally and professional, so at Ukie we run an initiative called Digital School House, which is all about play-based learning, so that’s not necessarily about saying, right sit down and play a video game, it’s about, a lot of it’s unplugged, so it’s using kind of games and mechanics to teach people the basis of algorithmic thinking, encourage people to look at games in the way that are kind of a creative pursuit in their own right, and yeah, on top of that I guess just the?  I’ve actually for some reason, I’ve been looking at trying to find a traffic flow simulation thing and actually you can get it in City Skyline, so things like that where you can apply – but also just, there’s a simulators level, there’s the Dota , I mean you can’t win a Dota match without coordinating as a team and thinking about tactics, strategy, all that kind of stuff, so I mean there is, yeah, a game it’s like saying, can you think of any wider applications for books, it’s funny because a game can cover any topic, anything that a book but in a different, more immersive way, so yeah I mean games, the application of games is the widest human experience.
Interviewer: So you think also they could be integrated into school programmes?
Respondent 13: Yeah, I mean we already do and that’s obviously off the shelf stuff, so an example of that, we run an e-sports school tournament which uses Rocket League to get people playing e-sports into schools as it were, between schools.  But as a result of that we saw that, not only do they obviously enjoy playing the game, but they’ve formed the teams, they’ve got the organisational structures together but needed to get an e-sports tournament together and teachers were saying that they had engagement with pupils who never normally engage in class through this.  They’ve got them into thinking about technology, so yeah, it’s kind of, you can use an off the peg games to have kind of knock on positive effects as well as saying, why you don’t play Civ-5, or it 6 now, to learn about world history, so yeah it’s the more obvious ways of doing it, but also just the whole act of playing a game can actually have lots of benefits as well. 
Interviewer: You mentioned you use off the shelf games, do you ever use games that were developed specifically for teaching something?
Respondent 13: Yes, so we’ve worked with some developers on that, on bespoke products.  I think some of the risk of that is, I think it’s again that, it’s that problem of those two words that don’t sort fit together, ‘serious and games’ I think so many games are based on trying to get education outcomes that they’ve become boring and no one wants to play them.  So, but there are lots of good examples out there to be fair, but I think you can, yeah, I think you’ll see more of that to be honest as actually, just rather than kind of educationalists making games, you’ll get games labs making games that educate rather than the other way around, so you will see that I think. 
Interviewer: Do you know the term gamification?
Respondent 13: Yes.  
Interviewer: Do you have any experience with gamification or any thoughts on that?
Respondent 13: Yeah, I mean it’s not a term I particularly like, but I get it, it encapsulates a lot of what’s going on.  Yeah, I sort of hear it a bit less now, there was a lot of kind of advertising agencies thinking about gamification and they can gamify marketing processes and so on, and you know, it’s cool, I think there’s something very strong there about the sense that all humans learn through play and engage through play and that has been increasingly recognised I think in education, so it maybe still is on our board, it’s setting up, school is very much an emphasis on that, about how you can rediscover the benefits of learning through play, and I think you can still, there’s all the examples of the, there’s a video on YouTube that’s been around a few year ago, about the – they were trying to encourage people in Sweden to walk up the stairs rather than take escalator, did you see that?  So they put a piano keyboard on the stairs. 
Interviewer: Oh yeah, I’ve seen that. 
Respondent 13: Yeah, that one, yeah that – I think you see sort of less of that, but I think it’s the principle of, you know, play is a way of engaging with people and getting them to learn things, getting them to change behaviours, there’s definitely something in it, but I’m not sure I’m that keen on the term.  
Interviewer: Moving on, do you see any ethical issues in the use of games, or in the message conveyed by games?
Respondent 13: Yeah, I mean again from what we do here at Ukie we obviously get a lot of people still saying, games are evil, they’ll melt your brain and make kids go and kill people and so on, and – but there’s nothing, I don’t think there’s anything inherently, there’s nothing inherently within games that makes them, you know, there’s no link to real world violence and there’s no evidence there for it.  I think obviously, yeah, the point is though the games are, the games have the same ethical issues as any other content, so you’ve got games for adults, games for children, the more people understand that games aren’t just for children, I think there’s still that kind of thing going, well it’s a video game so any child can play it, I think there’s still of that there.  
Respondent 13: So I think the industry does try and do its bit to make sure that’s addressed, but?  Is that what you meant in terms of the content and the way that games are made or-?
Interviewer: I’m sharing the key words with you, so you can get an idea what we are thinking about.  You’ve already touched upon the link between violent content and aggression. 
"Respondent 13: Yeah, but again, you know, on that there is no – all these kind of people sort of pop up every now and again and say, oh this is terrible and so on, and there’s two things there; and when you hear that parents send their kids to play, it’s like, well they shouldn’t be there, and I was – the approach I find is best is to go, did you notice what where someone’s tortured with some bolt cutters for example, they’re like, what; you say, well yeah that’s what your kid’s playing and that’s why they shouldn’t be playing it."
Respondent 13: But actually, on the other side of the coin, there is no evidence to actually, you know, if you play games you do not go out and kill people, you know, I think there’s still, despite what’s going on in the world at the moment, there’s still less violent crime in certain western societies than there has been for, well ever, and that is going down.  If it was the other way around, if more people are playing video games it’d be doing the – and there was a link to violence, it would have an impact upwards, so it doesn’t add up.  I know the clinical trials that are there don’t stack up.
"Respondent 13: I think we see less of finger-pointing at the games industry for that; I mean looking at some of your other things that people?  One of the things we’re very keen on doing is the whole gender diversity point.  I think, yeah there is much more to do with that, I don’t think it’s restricted just to games, I think the text sector generally is, probably is bad diversity-wise, but it’s not like we’re saying, it’s not a problem, so there’s lots that we’ve done to inspire women and people from different backgrounds into the sector, and that’s an ongoing effort and I think it is changing more, despite [0:21:49] and so on, but we’re seeing more female developers, we’ve got a good representation of female, the senior games industry, women on our board and so on, so it is happening more but more needs to be done."
Interviewer: But you think this is improving in general not just in your specific context?
Respondent 13: Within the games sector?  Is that what you mean, is it improving generally in the games sector?
Interviewer: Yeah. 
"Respondent 13: Yeah, I mean it’s a long way to go but I think there are, there seems to be willingness at the senior levels to do something about it and therefore that can only, hopefully go in the right direction; it can’t get much worse to be honest with you. "
Interviewer: Another thing I was thinking, you say you use games for teaching and education.
Respondent 13: Hmm-hmm. 
Interviewer: I was also thinking, do you see any obstacles or opportunities stemming from using games with people with disabilities?
Respondent 13: Yeah absolutely, one of the people we work very closely with is Special Effect, do you know them at all?
Interviewer: Sorry?
Respondent 13: Special Effect, it’s a charity.  
Interviewer: Oh no, I don’t know about it. 
"Respondent 13: Well just look at them because that will answer your question entirely.  So they’re a charity that uses games to help people with disabilities to play games and engage with people on a level playing field as it were.  So go to their website and look at some of the videos on there, I means they’re absolutely amazing, really inspiring; but again it’s the ability of games to – yeah, someone disabled to be able to play someone not disabled at FIFA or something and without any kind of hindrance to it, it’s amazing.  So there is absolutely a chance to do that and more of it.  "
Interviewer: Is it UK based?
Respondent 13: Yeah.  Special Effect, yeah. 
Interviewer: Moving more onto the entertainment side of video games, the general industry of video games.  How do you think of monetisation plans, like free-to-play games and EDLCs, I mean all those games that break away from the traditional way of selling games?
Respondent 13: Yeah, I don’t think – there was a lot of debate about it, there still is, but you know, it’s unethical and so on, and we’re actually involved with the?  There was a regulatory inquiry in the UK about that, about how you sell, particularly to children, how you represent what you’re doing, where you’re calling it a game-free and then there’s all these stories about parents going, yeah they said they were playing a free game and then I’ve got a bill for five-thousand pounds and so on.  So it wasn’t – yeah, I think there were some, when that happened there were some examples of some unscrupulous games out there that weren’t by any mainstream reputable games developers about the thing, you know, all these things about pay-up or the picture of a kitten gets killed sort of thing, all these examples that were really extreme examples but never really had much impact.  But generally there is no issue with that I don’t think, if the price is right and you’re not misleading consumers then there’s no moral issue there, and that’s, I think, what we certainly tried hard to make the case for, that there needs to be – yeah, and there’s a willingness to be transparent about it, and ultimately if people set the wrong price, people won’t play the game.
Respondent 13: If the community decides it’s not a good thing and therefore doesn’t work, and at best I think that model delivers more and better content to people when they want it, you know the whole, the sort of place about DLCs sometimes, like why isn’t this part of the original thing.  What is it, Destiny Ships, they found that all the DLC was actually on the disk, that was a bit, caused some hiccups.  But yeah, it’s still that ability to provide more content to people at regular basis if the price is right and I think it’s that basically, you’ve got to make money from a game and not many games do make money to be honest.  So if you can get commercial model right, I know it’s a moral issue. 
Interviewer: So you believe, if I’m getting you right, that it’s actually self-regulating so, I mean if the, it becomes too greedy I would say (laughs) people would stop buying that kind of games and it will die out, and for games that are just able to deliver more content with that money they will thrive and continue to be evoked, right?
Respondent 13: Yeah. 
Interviewer: Is that what you’re saying?
Respondent 13: Yeah, I mean Clash Of Clans hasn’t stayed up there, top of the charts for three years because it’s charging people too much money, it’s got the model right.  But yeah, that’s not to say there is space for the traditional model on mobile as well, so you still see, a lot of games companies still make good commercial business out of the, yeah, pay-me-in, whatever you want to call it model as well.  
Respondent 13: Yeah it’s still a console, the console is dominated by big paid for titles and I don’t see any sign of that happening.  I think, was it some research about how consumers value content and how they still think that the money, there’s no value for money.  So I think the music industry went through a lot of fuss a few years ago, going, people going, well why should I pay to keep Bono or whoever as millionaires, they’ve got enough, anyone can make a song, they devalued the art and creation in the song.  Whereas I think this survey said that they recognised how much effort goes into making a game and therefore they’re more prepared to pay for it, and actually that affects piracy as well. 
Interviewer: That effects, sorry?
Respondent 13: Piracy.  
Interviewer: Oh yeah.  Moving to a more abstract level, how do you feel that games impacts society?  It’s something you’ve already said, but what do you think the influence of games is on society?
Respondent 13: It’s going to be increasingly positive, as more and more people do it, more people just see it as a cultural pastime, like reading or watching a film, or reading a book, it’s just sort of become part of it, and I think it’s been really positive.  If you think about – my experience of games now and my experience of playing games with my kids it’s just, there is, I don’t see any bad effects at all, it’s all positive, it helps experience new worlds, their online connectivity, I don’t let them go online yet, but being able to get online and interact with people who you’d never normally play with, and just the act of playing games itself, it’s just a good fun thing to do.  It’s as wholesome as going out and playing football or something, it’s just a good thing to do.  
Respondent 13: I think increasingly, the way that people tell stories and put cultural points of views across, use games as a, more of an explicit art form as well, become more prevalent.  There’s lots of games out there, you know, this debate around a game, is it a game or is it art, is it a game or a walking simulator, it doesn’t matter, these are all kind of coming from the culture of games and that’s what is driving.  
Interviewer: Before you talked about children and video games, I’d like to ask you if you think that access to video games for children should be regulated?  And if so, in what way?
Respondent 13: Yeah I mean it is to a certain extent through age ratings, and in the UK we actually have a statutory, it’s part of the law about the PEGI age rating, so – but, you know, it’s up to parents to understand what kind of content is in a game, not to sort of think, oh well let them play games because games are for kids and then they found out there’s that torture scene in GTA or whatever.  But you don’t need to regulate any more than that, I mean a lot of it has to come – the main reason is that it has to be down to the parent ultimately.  
"Respondent 13: You can’t have a games institute representative to go to every house around the country and say, don’t do this, do that, and so on.  It has to be up to the parents to have the knowledge to do something if they need to, but also the tools they’ve got.  It’s up to industry to have trends and trials, put the right information out to, you know, not market games to the wrong age groups and that kind of stuff, which is all part of the PEGI guidelines; you’re not allowed to do that.  So as long as the industry’s holding up to its side of it, I think – yeah, it’s a shared responsibility basically, the parents need to have the tools to be able to make those decisions.  "
Interviewer: How do you see the marketing of video games, I mean how they are advertised and so on?  Do you see problems with that, or opportunities?
Respondent 13: Again it’s like saying do you see a problem with the marketing of books, it depends on the book and the people you’re selling it to.  So, you know, if you look at – the trailer for Everything that came out, the trailer, the marketing material is up for an Oscar, so what, you know, are you judging that against an advert for the latest Call of Duty, which will be [0:31:58] someone else, there’s no, I don’t think there’s any overarching trend of moral issue with advertising and in the UK, certainly there are strict rules about what you can, how you can and cannot advertise, you can’t mislead consumers, down to, you know there was a discussion we had with the advertising association about using in-game footage and so on, you can’t, you know, that whole thing you cannot claim that, that’s one or the other.  
Respondent 13: And also, I mentioned earlier, so if you sign up to PEGI games companies cannot advertise a sixteen-rated video game to children below that, and I know that’s difficult, because of the way people consume content on every – you know, my kids, you can stop them seeing trailers for sixteen-rated games, you can do it, but as long as you’re always aware of what they’re looking at and so on, then I don’t think there’s a problem. 
Respondent 13: Most games make, will err on the side of caution, will not be putting out, you know, extremely explicit content that could risk being seen by young people anyway.  But if you look at the trailer for Everything, it’s an Oscar-winning, it’s an eleven minute film in its own right, Oscar-nominated, sorry.  
Interviewer: Another thing we’ve already touched a little upon, but I’d like to talk about it a little more is innovation in games.  You say, okay, games have changed a lot in the last decades, but you say their core remains the same. 
Respondent 13: Hmm-hmm.
Interviewer: But I’d still like to know, how do you see the change and how do you see the future of video games?
Respondent 13: Yeah, there’s a lot of very smart people work in games obviously and it is, and by its very nature it is at the cutting edge of technology and culture, and level content creation.  So when I said their core remains the same, that’s kind of a pretty general term, obviously the technology and innovation does change and improve what they look like and how you can interact with them, so the core remains the same but there’s a lot around it that goes on.  
Respondent 13: Yeah, so all these smart people they’re leading the way in development of IA, of VR and AR obviously, in business models, engagement with customers, engagement with the public through things like e-sports, I mean there’s so much innovation going on, it’s constantly changing.  
"Respondent 13: The thing about, again our friends in the music industry, I think the problem they had a few years ago was, over twenty-five years they just had one business model and one technology, they just had a CD, and that was it, that was all they did, spent twenty-five years on that; in that twenty-five years, when you think of different formats and technologies and so on, the games you had, we had to always be cutting edge, so it’s always going to be innovative, it’s always going to be more innovative than the other preceptors and I think we should take the lead in debates about how those creative industries and creative sectors have an influence on the world, commercially and culture. "
Interviewer: One thing that emerged from another interview actually, is that big evolution was in online gaming because technologically we couldn’t do much online gaming in the early days of video games, and then a big – to be more and more widespread and I guess that was a little bit of a change in the core, because it became more and more a social activity.  But I don’t know how you feel about that, do you agree or disagree?
Respondent 13: Yeah, I mean – but the core thing of a game being, it has to be fun and engaging to play, that has to remain the same, whether it’s online or offline.  
"Respondent 13: I think the online element has had a lot – I remember?  The social element’s always there, I remember playing with Lee on the BBCB and we actually sliced together two aerial leads so we could put two tellies up to it, so you could pretend you were playing multiplayer, but it was a bit rubbish to be honest.  And then obviously, now I mean Doom, local networks play Doom, so it’s – it does add a new element.  I think things like Dota where you can actually hook up and play intense tactical team based, with masses of people you’ve never met and probably never will meet, or once you meet up you play with them.  Yeah it is a big change but that’s as much as a, you know, a cultural change about the connectivity, the internet brings generally; games is part of that, but yeah. "
Interviewer: How do you feel about VR?
Respondent 13: I’ve got a VR headset. 
Interviewer: Oh, lucky you. 
Respondent 13: I don’t use it as regularly as I did, that’s – I think there’s still a lot to be done on the content.  There was an interesting – so games are obviously leading the way on that, I think the best content ever is games and there was an interesting thing I read the other day, a survey that said, all these 360-degree experiences have been designed when Google tracked where people were looking, and seventy-five-percent of the people, even though they had 360-degrees possible, seventy-five-percent of people looked straight ahead the whole time.  So it’s like, well what’s – it’s like watching telly on a big screen.  
Respondent 13: But I think games do that, there are some amazing games out there.  I think the technology is still, while accessible, I don’t use mine as often as possible because it’s hard to get all the kit out, all the stuff.  I’ve got a five, so I’ve got all the tripods and everything out, so I mean it’s great when it works, but, and it does work well, but it’s just?  It will be, I think when the more AR stuff comes and the headsets get even smaller, and it will undoubted have an influence, yeah. 
Interviewer: Do you believe it will open new opportunities also for learning and education?
Respondent 13: What VR and AR?
Interviewer: Yeah, or do you see it more on the, just the entertainment side of video games?
Respondent 13: No, it’s both isn’t it, this is the whole point about games generally, interactive entertainment, they can do both at the same time.  They have to be one or the other.  I think I actually found it quite, I did that, the Apollo Mission, it was a simulation of Apollo 11, the first one to land on the moon, and obviously I know about that, but actually the experience of being in the command capsule or whatever as it’s drifting round the moon, it’s a quite a, a profound experience you can only have in VR so that’s pretty educational.  But ultimately it was a kind of fun, interactive experience as well, so it doesn’t have to be one or the other, it’s like games generally.  
Interviewer: Moving towards the end of the interview, we’ve talked a lot about opportunities of video games, and also some potential problems.  What advice would you give to different kinds of people involved with games to make this situation better or even better?
Respondent 13: Well we’d say to educators, we’re already doing, to start integrating games and some play-based learning into schools and also just to recognise that games are the embodiment of twenty-first century skillset that everyone needs.  So it’s that amazing blend of arts, creativity and story-telling with science, physics, with maths, and of course with computer science.  It’s a very – those are skills, we’d love everyone with those skills to go and make games, but equally they go on and build jet engines, or be engineers for bridges, or whatever, it’s that sense.  
Respondent 13: I think for institutions, so cultural institutions and governments in building this to separate down some of the kind of prejudice that may exist around games, for say arts funding for example, recognise games as a very legitimate form of cultural expression and art in their own right.  A lot of the people we speak to say about funding, well why isn’t this organisation funding and so on, there’s nothing kind of in their, you know, their governance structure that’s stopping it, it’s pure ignorance sometimes, so it’s breaking that down.  I think developers and publishers just keep on making and selling the amazing games they are, they are – to create amazing stuff.  
Respondent 13: One of the trends we’re actually seeing with, in the UK certainly is for small businesses, there’s a lot of people making amazing content but there is a shortage of business skills, so I think it’s also, if you’re making a game you’ve got to think about how you’re going to sell it, how you’re going to run the business required to sell it. 
Interviewer: Okay.  What would you say to parents, you talked before about the need for parents to monitor their children, right. 
Respondent 13: Yeah, it’s not so much monitoring I’d just start playing games with the kids, it’s fun, it’s something you can do together, and you can beat them at [Snuz 0:42:03], not out of the game, and yeah just that whole thing about actually just not, don’t be scared of them, don’t just dismiss them as some kind of frivolous pointless pastime and actually look at what some of the benefits could be to it.  My son loves them, he’s already asked me, he’s five, he’s like how do you make these things, so just giving him an understanding about how that happens, is hopefully going to inspire him to think about those skills in the future, so yeah.  
Interviewer: Anything you want to add we didn’t touch up, or closing remarks?
Respondent 13: No, I don’t think so, no.  There’s quite a lot to cover there, so it’s good.  Yeah, if I think of anything I’ll drop you a line.
Interviewer: That’s the end of the interview then, I thank you a lot for your time and your contribution, and if you’re interested I will send you the output of our analysis as soon as we have it, so you can see what are our conclusions. 
Respondent 13: Yeah, if you could actually.  There’s one question about the interviews you’ve done already, is there other common themes within that?
Interviewer: Yeah, quite a bit.  I’ve mostly interviewed players and a very common theme amongst players is the toxicity of online interactions, which is something that you didn’t mention, but it’s a very, very common topic actually. 
Respondent 13: Yeah, that’s interesting, I think there does tend to be – how to police that is a bit of a headache and how to do that.  I think you see – it’s interesting, some games have more toxic communities than others I notice.  You can play Overwatch for example, I don’t know if it’s just the nature of the game, or nature of the communications methods, but you don’t get the same, yeah it’s not as toxic.  
"Respondent 13: Whereas Dota is really, it’s almost part of the culture; I noticed when I first started playing I was like, I’ll get some real grief for not, not deliberately doing badly, but it’s?  But then I guess once you’re immersed in it, it’s kind of part of it and actually it doesn’t normally straight into toxic, and in that example, [0:44:28] I’ve been in probably just a handfuls of examples where someone’s crossed the line and they’ve been reported to by everyone in the game, that you’re going to go up and [0:44:36] so we’ve taken action, and they won’t be playing any time soon.  So that kind of thing does work, but yeah, I wonder if there’s anything interesting about the type of game, or the type of communication channels that makes things more toxic, or less toxic. "
Interviewer: Another quite common theme in the interviews is a kind of scepticism towards educational games.  Optimism for off-the-shelf games used for education, pessimism towards serious games, that’s emerged in quite a bit of the interviews. 
"Respondent 13: You can tell that from me as well.  That’s not to delegate, there are still some good examples, but to say, a lot of them just, they’re not fun, and what’s the point, it’s missing the whole point of what a game can do, and especially for young people; okay, hey why don’t you play this really serious game about something really boring or why don’t you learn about movement of trade through playing Civ or city, all the infrastructure required to build a city through playing City Skyline or stuff like that, so you don’t need to reinvent some of these things, some expert game designer’s already done it for you.  "
Interviewer: Personally I have quite a bit of doubt also on the use of off-the-shelf games, because I mean there is some kind of paradox in using games for education in that it becomes, I don’t know in some way something you have to do.  I don’t know, I have some scepticism because there are some very well-regarded off-the-shelf games which for me personally are boring because they’re not my genre, and so I think if I had to play them, I mean if I had to play Call of Duty that’s not my kind of game, I would be miserable, even if it’s a good game.  
Respondent 13: Yeah, I agree.  But there are some, if you’re given the choice between, I don’t know, learning about physics through looking at how a racing car behaves in cars or something, or would you like to just read a book about it, it’s things like that.  I totally agree with Call of Duty by the way as well, but yeah, there is a bit of a challenge there, but still it’s like, again it’s that example of, games, there are many types of games as there are books, or there soon will be, or topics for discussion, so there will increasingly be the right kind of game for the right kind of lesson and you can’t teach anything by games, but they shouldn’t just be dismissed as frivolous pointless pastimes basically.  
Interviewer: Yeah.  Okay, if you don’t have any other questions I think that’s it.
